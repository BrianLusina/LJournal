How do you even acquire the clout &#x26; clamor of a billionaire? Do you learn it over time? Is it natural? Is it passed down through induction? Or is it just for the select few gifted people?</p>\n<p>Well, I can say for a fact that billionaries are just human beings like everyone else, except that they well, you know, have billions and they make money while they sleep. However, if you think about billionaires did not just suddenly start out like that, they must have had a turning point at some point in time or they discovered something that the rest of human kind is always going to crave for.</p>\n<p>What did they discover? What do they do? What don’t they do? Obviously, these are normal men, with normal upbringing &#x26; faced the same challenges as their peers but there came a time when they broke loose from their peers &#x26; ended up where they are.</p>\n<p>Billionaires have 5 things in common that made them be where &#x26; what they are.</p>\n<p>The five things are:</p>\n<h3>1. They Understand The Power Of Many (Numbers.)</h3>\n<p>The richer you are, the more you disassociate self from the business, but the poorer you are, the more you want to identify with your business.</p>\n<p>Successful business people do not have a <em>my business</em> attitued, instead they have a <em>our business idea</em> attitued. That’s why when you go to a fancy 7 star hotel, chances are some employees there do not know who owns the place &#x26; have never seen him/her. But when you go to a poor person’s business, that person is always there, worse even acting as the cashier, accountant, attendant, etc.</p>\n<p>The trick of business success is in numbers not in self. As long as you have a personal business called “mine” then be sure u are headed for poverty. People die but companies outlive them.</p>\n<h3>2. They Are Serious Borrowers.</h3>\n<p>Borrowing money is their cup of tea &#x26; signature. If you have never borrowed money, you will never lend money; &#x26; can't lend it if you don’t have it.</p>\n<p>A bank is a broker between the poor &#x26; the rich. The only place where the you meet is in a bank. The poor bring the money &#x26; the rich take it. A poor person saves money because they have more money than their thinking capacity. So they keep the money there so they can go &#x26; think what to do with it.</p>\n<p>Rich people borrow that very same money because they have more ideas than their money. So they come to pick that money and &#x26; implement those great ideas.</p>\n<p>Only poor people operate savings &#x26; fixed deposit accounts. Fixed deposit accounts are for the living dead. People who undertake &#x26; commit that they will not think about any idea for that money until the expiry of that period of time, otherwise they will be penalized. Rich people operate current accounts. Therefore, a bank exists purposely for 2 reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For the poor to bring in the money</li>\n<li>For the rich to come &#x26; take it away.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Banks make more money from borrowers than savers. Hence they respect the former more.</p>\n<h3>3. They have High Level NETWORKS!</h3>\n<p>These people as explained in the 1st point believe in the power of many. As a result, they have many like-minded friends who can be of benefit to them. They have friends all over. Rich people have no age, tribal, geographical or gender boundaries. It doesn’t matter who or what you are as long as you are of value to their ventures.</p>\n<p>Building such networks needs a lot of travelling &#x26; interacting with people. People never get rich in their hometown. Somebody who dreams of being rich, regardless of their age or status, must have;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Driving license (because they will own a car – its criminal to be seeing cars everyday but never own one.),</li>\n<li>A Passport (because you must travel widely to expand your networks &#x26; sharpen your mindset – If you have been buying a suit in Kenya for Ksh. 30,000) &#x26; find it in China at Ksh. 800, your language &#x26; ideas change)</li>\n<li>You must know how you swim because you are going to have fun &#x26; relax.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. They Are Great Risk Takers!</h3>\n<p>As long as you avoid taking risks, you are headed to the grave poor. Taking risks is like walking in the dark. You know where you are going but can’t see it yet. Better still, you are more confident &#x26; secure when you are accompanied than when alone. The more people you have, the more secure, hence the 1st point.</p>\n<p>Risk taking is about numbers.</p>\n<h3>5. They Have Read The BIBLE!</h3>\n<p>They understand &#x26; make use of the parable of the sower. The seed is the shilling. They put the shilling on fertile land. They simply know where to put their money &#x26; where not to put it.</p>\n<p>They understand the current business trends &#x26; make business decisions with this in mind. If you bought a plot 5 years ago at Ksh. 500,000, you are worth nothing 5 years later except that plot even if it will be worth 2M.</p>\n<p>A rich person will invest that same money somewhere where it will be worth 2B within the same period of time. That’s why you find a 2-bedroom house varying from Ksh. 2,000 to Sh. 80,00 or even more from one place to another.</p>\n<p>Or a cup of tea ranging from 5 shillings to Ksh. 1,000. Yet when you ask all these business people, you will discover that each one of them decided the price. Why the variance?</p>\n<p>They know the value chain. In business the “Higher you go, the cooler it becomes &#x26; the lower the pressure\".</p>\n<p>A landlord collecting 2,000 for a 2-bedroom house has more problems than his colleague collecting 80,000 for the same house elsewhere.</p>\n<p>While one has to literally come collecting payments at 4am every 1st day of the month (lest the tenant escapes), the other’s money is safely banked in his account even before the month ends. While one can even bargain with the tenant about the rent, the other is fixed, &#x26; u either take it or leave it.</p>\n<p>While one, regardless of the cheap rent has few tenants, the other has a problem of too many tenants coming to look for housing.</p>\n<p>Same with the tea business. The one worth 5 shillings comes in a bigger cup than the one worth 200 times that.</p>\n<p>You should know where to put your money. Create value for your cash, don’t battle with market prices. They are not your limit.</p>\n<p>It's better to be the last among the rich than to be the 1st among the poor.</p>\n<p>A Poor (POOR) Person Is One Who <em>Passes Over Opportunities Repeatedly.</em></p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The Risk Process","subtitle":"A small breakdown of the risk process","excerpt":"A small breakdown of the risk process","path":"/finance/risk-process","date":"January 18, 2017","author":{"name":"Brian Lusina","link":"/brian_lusina","avatar":"brian_lusina.jpg"},"image":{"feature":"ruintheory.JPG","thumbnail":null,"teaser":"ruintheory.JPG","credit":"Wikipedia","creditlink":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruin_theory"},"tags":["Actuarial","Insurance","Money","business"]},"excerpt":"The Ruin Theory or surplus process or risk process defines when a company is most likely to go bankrupt given a constant flow of income and…","timeToRead":2,"html":"<p>The <strong>Ruin Theory</strong> or <em>surplus process</em> or <em>risk process</em> defines when a company is most likely to go bankrupt given a constant flow of income and random outflow of cash. This is used in most businesses to determine for how long the company can be expected to be in operation before their wallet does not allow them to continue.</p>\n<p>Of course this is all probability and does not give an exact date or exact metrics as to when or high likely this will occur. However, it does help a company properly assess where they are currently and where they should avoid given current circumstances are unfavorable.</p>\n<p>Let us assume that a business starts with an initial capital amount. All businesses have constant income from sell of services or goods, or in the case of insurance companies from premium income. Additionally, these same businesses have cash outflow, which oftentimes is random and can not be accurately predicted. These cash outflows are random in both timing and amount and thus a company ought to be careful and ensure that their initial capital does not fall below 0 or is less than the cash outflow at any given time or they will face what is known as <strong>ruin</strong>(bankruptcy).</p>\n<p>As you can imagine, this involves a lot of mathematical calculation and often graphs to properly access when the company may experience ruin. Since the cash inflow is constant and can be determined, what is left to determine is the time and amount of cash outflow. Once these two random variables are determined, then the whole process is more visible and can be properly drawn on paper.</p>\n<p>This process can be outlined by the graph below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6b/Samplepathcompoundpoisson.JPG/350px-Samplepathcompoundpoisson.JPG\" alt=\"ruin process\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From our good friends Wikipedia</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course it looks a bit intimidating but a breakdown is coming right up. Before that though, we can see from this picture that there are 2 sides to the graph, the part below the X-axis is obviously bad, as it means the company is bankrupt. The vertical drops in the graph are the cash outflows and are dotted as we can not properly determine when they will occur. The diagonal lines are the cash inflow and those can be properly determined.\nThe graph does no start at coordinate <code>0,0</code> as this is the initial reserve or capital the company starts with.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"5 Main types of Non-life insurance problems","subtitle":"Determining factors of capital retention in general insurance","excerpt":"Determining factors of capital retention in general insurance","path":"/finance/types-of-problems-in-non-life","date":"January 17, 2017","author":{"name":"Brian Lusina","link":"/brian_lusina","avatar":"brian_lusina.jpg"},"image":{"feature":"capital-retention-insurance.jpg","thumbnail":null,"teaser":"capital-retention-insurance.jpg","credit":"Shine.com","creditlink":"http://info.shine.com/article/talent-retention-is-a-big-challenge-for-insurance-firms/8814.html"},"tags":["Actuarial","Insurance","Money","business"]},"excerpt":"Following what I wrote about last time(feel free to check it out), I will follow up with that and mention briefly the problems General…","timeToRead":2,"html":"<p>Following what I wrote about last <a href=\"https://brianlusina.github.io//money/non-life-actuarial-problems/\">time</a>(feel free to check it out), I will follow up with that and mention briefly the problems General insurance companies usually face when it comes to retaining risk especially when dealing with a portfolio.</p>\n<p>The factors are(for those who are rebels and just will not read my previous article :D), <em>capital a company has</em>, <em>risk willingness</em> and <em>profit margin</em>. These are the 3 main factors that determine what a company retains when it is faced with insuring a risk.</p>\n<p>Retention of a company will be high if these 3 factors are high. This is usually governed by this formula:</p>\n<p>$$Retention=(capital _ risk willingness _ profit margin)/unbalancness$$</p>\n<p>And it is from this funny looking formula that we are able to determine the 5 main types of problems:</p>\n<h3>1. Rating</h3>\n<p>This is faced in premium calculation and is usually characterized by the formula:</p>\n<p>$$Profit margin = (Retention _ unbalanceness) / (capital _ risk willingness)$$</p>\n<h3>2. Assessing Reserves</h3>\n<p>Characterized as <strong>contingency reserves</strong> or <strong>risk capital</strong> or <strong>catastrophe funds</strong>, this is determined by this formula:</p>\n<p>$$Capital = (Retention _ Unbalanceness) / (Profit Margin _ Risk)$$</p>\n<p>So as the name suggests, these are funds that are accessed when the company needs is in crisis.</p>\n<h3>3. Underwriting limit</h3>\n<p>This determines what amount of risk they should retain. Which is essentially the original formula:</p>\n<p>$$Retention=(capital _ risk willingness _ profit margin)/unbalancness$$</p>\n<h3>4. Risk Behavior</h3>\n<p>Companies' entrepreneurial attitude towards risk can be categorized as their behavior towards risk. This formula can be used to determine or measure how conservative or not a company ought to be given its current circumstances.</p>\n<p>$$Risk Willingness = (Retention _ Unbalanceness) / (Profit margin _ Capital)$$</p>\n<h3>5. Maximum tolerable risk load</h3>\n<p>A company may be able to bear on its gross account a certain amount of risk given its rate level, retention and financial strength as well as its behavior towards risk.</p>\n<p>$$Unbalanceness = (Capital _ Risk willingness _ Profit margin) / retention$$</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>As you will notice the 5 main problems are derived from the very same basic formula:</p>\n<p>$$Retention=(capital _ risk willingness _ profit margin)/unbalancness$$</p>\n<p>Most companies go by this formula, especially insurance companies. This is often used when governing how much they should retain on their account when they are faced with insuring a certain portfolio of risks.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Non Life Insurance Problems in Life","subtitle":"Problems in Non-Life Insurance","excerpt":"Problems in Non-Life Insurance","path":"/finance/non-life-actuarial-problems","date":"January 16, 2017","author":{"name":"Brian Lusina","link":"/brian_lusina","avatar":"brian_lusina.jpg"},"image":{"feature":"nonlife-insurance-problems.jpg","thumbnail":null,"teaser":"nonlife-insurance-problems.jpg","credit":"Life Marketers","creditlink":"http://www.lifemarketers.com/life-insurance-general-agency/non-med-life-insurance"},"tags":["Actuarial","Insurance","Money","business"]},"excerpt":"The title may not be as intuitive or as smart as it should be, but I assure that the title is the least of concerns.

This may be a very common topic when it comes to the insurance sector, but, hey, why not shed some more light on it anyway.</p>\n<p>Insurance is very critical to business and in order for these businesses to keep operating despite calamities, they need insurance to ensure that no matter what happens they can keep their doors open.</p>\n<p>But, this is on the side of businesses and that is entirely different, today I shall shed some light on the fundamental problems of <em>Non life insurance</em> on Insurance companies. Call it flipping the coin and viewing it from the other side.</p>\n<p>This is a high-level view of what I am talking about.</p>\n<p>Actuaries deal with all kinds of mathematical and statistical problems in insurance. Insurance companies accept risks (potential claims) from their clients against a certain price called the premium. If a risk or a portfolio of risks is too large for a company, it will pass parts of it to one or several companies (its <em>re-insurance</em>) and remain with a part of it (its <em>retention</em>). If a risk is very large, some re-insurers pass parts of the acceptances to other companies so that the original risk or portfolio is covered by an entire network of insurers and re-insurance arrangements between a number of companies each of them carrying the retention they deem appropriate. Therefore, the amount of a company retains depend on a lot of things:</p>\n<h3>Capital of a company</h3>\n<p>This is obviously a big deal. A company with a large capital base can afford to retain more on its account than a company with a smaller capital base.</p>\n<h3>Management risk willingness</h3>\n<p>This all depends on the management and their risk appetite. The only question to ask here is <em>is the management willing to take risks?</em>. And this usually leads to, <em>if so, how much?</em>. A manager with a smaller risk appetite will not take as much risk as his/her counterpart. Thus we expect the former to retain less on the company account.</p>\n<h3>Profitability of the company</h3>\n<p>How profitable will be company be in undertaking a risk? We all know that the most basic of any company goal is to make a profit. It's usually hidden under the many missions and visions it share with the public. Internally, the company's main goal is to make a profit.\nThe <em>underwriter</em> needs to set appropriate premiums and assess whether the portfolio will produce a profit given unusual claims are not reported.</p>\n<p>These are just some of the basics and I will ensure to highlight more in days to come.\nIn the meantime, digest this information and comment if you like.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Money"}}}
