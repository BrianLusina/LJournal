Being top of your class does not necessarily guarantee that you will be at the top of life. You could graduate as the best student in finace but it doesn't mean you will make more money thatn everybody else. The best graduating law student does not necessarily make the best lawyer.</p>\n<p>The fact is life requires more than the ability to understand a concept, memoriese it and reproduce it in an exam. School rewards people for their memory, Life rewards people for their imagination.</p>\n<p>School rewards caution, while life rewards daring.\nSchool hails those who live by the rules, byt life exalts those who break the rules and set new ones.</p>\n<p>So, do I mean people should not study hard in school? Oh no! By all means you should. However, don't sacrifice every other thing on the alter of first class.</p>\n<p>Do not limit yourself to the classrorm. Do something practical. Take a leadership position. Start a business and fail. That is a better Entrepreneurship 101.</p>\n<p>Join or start a club. Contest and election and lose. It will teach you something Polition Science 101 will not teach you. Attend a seminar. Read books outside the scope of your corse. Go on missions and win a soul for eternal rewards...Do something you believe in!</p>\n<p>Think less of becoming an excellent student but think more of becoming an excellent person. Make the world your classroom.</p>\n<p>Don't you ever allow the level of education you have become your prision.</p>\n<p>Make the world your classroom! Have an amazing week ahead.</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"eduction"}}}
