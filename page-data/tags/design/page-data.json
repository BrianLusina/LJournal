Requires effort, perserverence and sweat. Also, coffee, lack of sleep and frustrating arguments with your computer. Either way, it is still an exciting journey that teaches you a lot of things, whether you are an expert or starting out. To truly become an expert or proficient in your skill, you need to practice it every single day. The 10,000 hour rule applies everywhere and thus is no exception to this.</p>\n<h2>User Experience, User Interface, what's the difference?</h2>\n<p>User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) are two terms used interchangeably, which is very wrong to do so. They are very much related, but do not mean the same thing, If you are going to be doing front end work, it is imperative to note the difference and be able to distinguish the two every time you create an app, a website or even a simple one pager site. These two terms could not be more different like the Sun and the moon, but they are both celestial bodies.</p>\n<h2>User Experience</h2>\n<p>User experience, as the name suggests, is basically the experience the user gets when using a partifuclar websites or application. The experience has to be fluid simple and fulfilling for the user. Therefore if your site or application is about blog posts and news feeds, it should be able to display these posts in a simple way such that the user has a fluid and dynamic experience with the software.</p>\n<h2>User Interface</h2>\n<p>User interface describes how the user and your software interact. This could be how the user interacts with your web page or your mobile application. The interface is like the outer covering of your application or web page. It is supposed to be able to allow the user to dynamically interact with your website and at the same time look appealing to attract even more users, because, let us face it, human beings are quite vain and we like things that look good. So, a good user interface allows the user to enjoy using your application as well as reaping the benefits it has to offer.</p>\n<p>UI and UX are not mutually exclusive, at the very least that is my take on it. In order to create software that offers user the best experience, you also need to be able to create an interface that the user can interact with well. They are not synonymous, but they should surely not be treated separately.</p>\n<h2>Algorithms</h2>\n<p>I am going to create a series of posts, most will be Algorithm problems based on how I see it. Of course none of these are the Gospel truth, as there are always hundreds of ways to solve an algorithm problem, we are just always looking for solution that gets the problem solved the fastest. Therefore the best algorithm, is the one that gets to the solution in the shortest time frame, but also does it accurately, of course the best solution does not necessarily have to be the one that does it in the shortest time frame as it could possibly not give accurate results. So, you need to look at <em>cost and benefit approach</em> and pick the one that gets the solution, minimising errors and giving you the intended result.</p>\n<h1>Bottom Line</h1>\n<p>My bottom line is to put in the effort and constantly keep learning. This is the one thing that keeps evolving and so should you. Keep changing your approach to things, while maintaning your goal in mind and you will become an excellent front end developer and more. I suppose the best approach is to always evaluate and ask yourself, 'If I was going to use this program, what would I like to see?'. And then make it as simple as you can to people who are unfamiliar with programming and its fundamentals. Break it down completely, the user does not need to know how it fully works, they just need to know that it works well, and that is why front end development is crucial as it presents the best possible image of the program and allows the users to enjoy the full functionality of the program without fully knowing what is under the hood.</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"design"}}}
