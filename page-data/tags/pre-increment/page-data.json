Post increment is usually denoted as <code>x++</code>, where the x is the variable in question, usually an integer, double or float. While pre-increment is addition denoted as <code>++x</code>.</p>\n<h1>Pre-increment</h1>\n<p>As the terms suggests, <em>PRE-increment</em> is the addition of a particular value before it is used. It is normally used when you want to use the incremented value of that particular variable. When the program encounters a pre-increment it increases the value of that variable in the memory then loads the expression.</p>\n<p>A simple demonstration:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">public class PostAndPre {\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n        int x = 0;\n        for(int i = 0; i &#x3C; 10; i++){\n            System.out.printf(\"%d\\n\", ++x);\n            /*Output:\n            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 */\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Demo of pre-increment</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above variable <code>x</code> is instantiated as 0. The program encounters the variable <code>x</code> and increases the value by 1 before output of the result.</p>\n<p>This is equivalent to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-Java\">        x = x + 1;\n        int y = x;\n        System.out.printf(\"%d\", y);\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Post-increment</h1>\n<p>The <em>post increment</em> uses the variable before increasing it. So in the case of <code>x++</code>, the variable will be 0, and will be used as is before it will be increased. This loads the value of that variable in memory, increases the variable and then continues reading the expression.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">        int l = 0;\n        for(int i = 0; i &#x3C; 10; i++){\n            System.out.printf(\"%d \\t\", l++);\n            //output 0  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9\n        }\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Demo of post increment</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above variable <code>l</code> is instantiated as 0 and will be output as 0, before the variable is increased.</p>\n<p>Code snippet can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/BrianLusina/Java-Playground/blob/master/Toy%20Problems/src/PostAndPre/PostAndPre.java\">here</a>.</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"pre-increment"}}}
