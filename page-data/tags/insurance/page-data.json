This is used in most businesses to determine for how long the company can be expected to be in operation before their wallet does not allow them to continue.</p>\n<p>Of course this is all probability and does not give an exact date or exact metrics as to when or high likely this will occur. However, it does help a company properly assess where they are currently and where they should avoid given current circumstances are unfavorable.</p>\n<p>Let us assume that a business starts with an initial capital amount. All businesses have constant income from sell of services or goods, or in the case of insurance companies from premium income. Additionally, these same businesses have cash outflow, which oftentimes is random and can not be accurately predicted. These cash outflows are random in both timing and amount and thus a company ought to be careful and ensure that their initial capital does not fall below 0 or is less than the cash outflow at any given time or they will face what is known as <strong>ruin</strong>(bankruptcy).</p>\n<p>As you can imagine, this involves a lot of mathematical calculation and often graphs to properly access when the company may experience ruin. Since the cash inflow is constant and can be determined, what is left to determine is the time and amount of cash outflow. Once these two random variables are determined, then the whole process is more visible and can be properly drawn on paper.</p>\n<p>This process can be outlined by the graph below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6b/Samplepathcompoundpoisson.JPG/350px-Samplepathcompoundpoisson.JPG\" alt=\"ruin process\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From our good friends Wikipedia</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course it looks a bit intimidating but a breakdown is coming right up. Before that though, we can see from this picture that there are 2 sides to the graph, the part below the X-axis is obviously bad, as it means the company is bankrupt. The vertical drops in the graph are the cash outflows and are dotted as we can not properly determine when they will occur. The diagonal lines are the cash inflow and those can be properly determined.\nThe graph does no start at coordinate <code>0,0</code> as this is the initial reserve or capital the company starts with.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"5 Main types of Non-life insurance problems","subtitle":"Determining factors of capital retention in general insurance","excerpt":"Determining factors of capital retention in general insurance","path":"/finance/types-of-problems-in-non-life","date":"January 17, 2017","author":{"name":"Brian Lusina","link":"/brian_lusina","avatar":"brian_lusina.jpg"},"image":{"feature":"capital-retention-insurance.jpg","thumbnail":null,"teaser":"capital-retention-insurance.jpg","credit":"Shine.com","creditlink":"http://info.shine.com/article/talent-retention-is-a-big-challenge-for-insurance-firms/8814.html"},"tags":["Actuarial","Insurance","Money","business"]},"excerpt":"Following what I wrote about last time(feel free to check it out), I will follow up with that and mention briefly the problems General…","timeToRead":2,"html":"<p>Following what I wrote about last <a href=\"https://brianlusina.github.io//money/non-life-actuarial-problems/\">time</a>(feel free to check it out), I will follow up with that and mention briefly the problems General insurance companies usually face when it comes to retaining risk especially when dealing with a portfolio.</p>\n<p>The factors are(for those who are rebels and just will not read my previous article :D), <em>capital a company has</em>, <em>risk willingness</em> and <em>profit margin</em>. These are the 3 main factors that determine what a company retains when it is faced with insuring a risk.</p>\n<p>Retention of a company will be high if these 3 factors are high. This is usually governed by this formula:</p>\n<p>$$Retention=(capital _ risk willingness _ profit margin)/unbalancness$$</p>\n<p>And it is from this funny looking formula that we are able to determine the 5 main types of problems:</p>\n<h3>1. Rating</h3>\n<p>This is faced in premium calculation and is usually characterized by the formula:</p>\n<p>$$Profit margin = (Retention _ unbalanceness) / (capital _ risk willingness)$$</p>\n<h3>2. Assessing Reserves</h3>\n<p>Characterized as <strong>contingency reserves</strong> or <strong>risk capital</strong> or <strong>catastrophe funds</strong>, this is determined by this formula:</p>\n<p>$$Capital = (Retention _ Unbalanceness) / (Profit Margin _ Risk)$$</p>\n<p>So as the name suggests, these are funds that are accessed when the company needs is in crisis.</p>\n<h3>3. Underwriting limit</h3>\n<p>This determines what amount of risk they should retain. Which is essentially the original formula:</p>\n<p>$$Retention=(capital _ risk willingness _ profit margin)/unbalancness$$</p>\n<h3>4. Risk Behavior</h3>\n<p>Companies' entrepreneurial attitude towards risk can be categorized as their behavior towards risk. This formula can be used to determine or measure how conservative or not a company ought to be given its current circumstances.</p>\n<p>$$Risk Willingness = (Retention _ Unbalanceness) / (Profit margin _ Capital)$$</p>\n<h3>5. Maximum tolerable risk load</h3>\n<p>A company may be able to bear on its gross account a certain amount of risk given its rate level, retention and financial strength as well as its behavior towards risk.</p>\n<p>$$Unbalanceness = (Capital _ Risk willingness _ Profit margin) / retention$$</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>As you will notice the 5 main problems are derived from the very same basic formula:</p>\n<p>$$Retention=(capital _ risk willingness _ profit margin)/unbalancness$$</p>\n<p>Most companies go by this formula, especially insurance companies. This is often used when governing how much they should retain on their account when they are faced with insuring a certain portfolio of risks.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Non Life Insurance Problems in Life","subtitle":"Problems in Non-Life Insurance","excerpt":"Problems in Non-Life Insurance","path":"/finance/non-life-actuarial-problems","date":"January 16, 2017","author":{"name":"Brian Lusina","link":"/brian_lusina","avatar":"brian_lusina.jpg"},"image":{"feature":"nonlife-insurance-problems.jpg","thumbnail":null,"teaser":"nonlife-insurance-problems.jpg","credit":"Life Marketers","creditlink":"http://www.lifemarketers.com/life-insurance-general-agency/non-med-life-insurance"},"tags":["Actuarial","Insurance","Money","business"]},"excerpt":"The title may not be as intuitive or as smart as it should be, but I assure that the title is the least of concerns.

This may be a very common topic when it comes to the insurance sector, but, hey, why not shed some more light on it anyway.</p>\n<p>Insurance is very critical to business and in order for these businesses to keep operating despite calamities, they need insurance to ensure that no matter what happens they can keep their doors open.</p>\n<p>But, this is on the side of businesses and that is entirely different, today I shall shed some light on the fundamental problems of <em>Non life insurance</em> on Insurance companies. Call it flipping the coin and viewing it from the other side.</p>\n<p>This is a high-level view of what I am talking about.</p>\n<p>Actuaries deal with all kinds of mathematical and statistical problems in insurance. Insurance companies accept risks (potential claims) from their clients against a certain price called the premium. If a risk or a portfolio of risks is too large for a company, it will pass parts of it to one or several companies (its <em>re-insurance</em>) and remain with a part of it (its <em>retention</em>). If a risk is very large, some re-insurers pass parts of the acceptances to other companies so that the original risk or portfolio is covered by an entire network of insurers and re-insurance arrangements between a number of companies each of them carrying the retention they deem appropriate. Therefore, the amount of a company retains depend on a lot of things:</p>\n<h3>Capital of a company</h3>\n<p>This is obviously a big deal. A company with a large capital base can afford to retain more on its account than a company with a smaller capital base.</p>\n<h3>Management risk willingness</h3>\n<p>This all depends on the management and their risk appetite. The only question to ask here is <em>is the management willing to take risks?</em>. And this usually leads to, <em>if so, how much?</em>. A manager with a smaller risk appetite will not take as much risk as his/her counterpart. Thus we expect the former to retain less on the company account.</p>\n<h3>Profitability of the company</h3>\n<p>How profitable will be company be in undertaking a risk? We all know that the most basic of any company goal is to make a profit. It's usually hidden under the many missions and visions it share with the public. Internally, the company's main goal is to make a profit.\nThe <em>underwriter</em> needs to set appropriate premiums and assess whether the portfolio will produce a profit given unusual claims are not reported.</p>\n<p>These are just some of the basics and I will ensure to highlight more in days to come.\nIn the meantime, digest this information and comment if you like.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Insurance"}}}
