Categories include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Worst Case complexity</strong>: When the amount ot time required by an algorithm for a given input is maximum.</li>\n<li><strong>Average-case complexity</strong>: When the amount of time required by an algorithm for a given input is average.</li>\n<li><strong>Best case complexity</strong>: When the amount of time required by an algorithm for a given input is minimum.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Space Complexity</h1>\n<p>Space taken by an algorithm to execute a given problem. This depends on the data structure being worked on</p>\n<h1>Asymptotic Analysis</h1>\n<p>Kind of analysis done to calculate the complexity of an algorithm in its theoretical analysis. A alarge length of input is used to calculate the complexity function of the algorithm. A graph is usually used.\nAsymptotic denotes a condition where a line tends to meet a curve, but they do not intersect. Here the line and the curve is asymptotic to each other. It involves computing the running time of any any operation in mathematical units of computation.\nThe <em>Big-O-notation</em> is used for this</p>\n<h2>Asymptotic notations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Big-O notation usually denoted as <strong>O</strong>.
