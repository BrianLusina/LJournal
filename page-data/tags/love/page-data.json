To me, you were a stranger, but I wanted to know you, get the chance to explore your thoughts, hates, likes, dislikes. Get to know who you truly were. I have to be honest, I did not know how to talk to girls, I tried so many tactics and I had always failed. It was almost as if I was studying for an exam. You never know what is coming in the test, but you know you want to pass it. Anyway, I digress. I first saw you and thought, wow, I want to actually just get to know you, just talk for hours and not feel any pressure for some grand gesture to win you over. Like those Hollywood movies. I hate them, honestly. They come with so many expectations on love, always as if love can be summed up in 2 hours of screen play.</p>\n<p>I always ran out of things to say, probably because I wanted to impress you and just said things over and over differently. You laughed and smiled slightly. You probably knew what was going on in my head, but, the calm face you kept was something else. It made me feel confident, not enough to go fight of bears for you, but enough to do silly things without a care in the world.</p>\n<p>Do I sometimes wonder whether life would have paired us differently? All the time. Every day, I ask myself(the universe, maybe), what is it that happened to make us meet? Star alignment? Cosmic disruption? Celestial bodies colliding? I did not know. What I did know, was that I was willing to give this a shot. Maybe I would fail horribly. You probably told your girlfriends about me and they just nodded their heads in response and asked you \"why him again?\". At least, that is how I hope it went.</p>\n<p>You remember the time we went for a picnic? I recall it like it was yesterday. I was nervous, sweaty and panicking on the inside. I did not know how to even act. But, somehow, all this was on the inside, including the sweating, thank God. That would have been embarassing. We laughed, smiled, made fun of each other and got lost in each other. I loved that day. It was away from all the noise of the city. All the struggles and doubt. I was happy. Probably, happier than I usually am.</p>\n<p>I was not only happy because I got a chance to spend the day with this wonderful human being that decided to block out her day just for me, but also happy that despite my numerous flaws, you picked me out of a bunch of guys, and I know there were a bunch of guys, I mean who would not have wanted to get a chance to be with you? I was not the smartest in a room, there are times I asked(still ask) the dumbest questions. I tend to be a bit slow to react to some things happening around me. Maybe, because I overthink the situation and start drawing parallel posibilities. You would not want to be in my head actually. And that is not something that I would ever boast about. I even almost lost you because I was in too deep in my head instead of being in the present. Honestly, that is my biggest flaw and for a long time, I have been working on that. Thank you for being so patient with me. You always have been. But, there was a time you were not always as patient and I get that. You were so mad at me. And for some reason that made me realize that I wanted to fight for you even more. It was at that moment that I realized I want to only be with you and only you.</p>\n<p>I guess what I am saying here is that no matter what happens, I hope you know how deeply I care. How much love I have for you. I would fight for you even when I stood no chance of winning, the thought of losing you would be more devastating than actually losing the fight. As I said, I am no poet, so probably around here, would be a simile or metaphor to something that would communicate better what I feel on the inside. Regardless, I will be here for you, on your side till time ends.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Live Life!","subtitle":"live life to the fullest","excerpt":"live life to the fullest","path":"/life/life-life","date":"May 07, 2017","author":{"name":"Brian Lusina","link":"/brian_lusina","avatar":"brian_lusina.jpg"},"image":{"feature":null,"thumbnail":null,"teaser":null,"credit":null,"creditlink":null},"tags":["Live","Love","Laugh","Life"]},"excerpt":"Live each day to the fullest.
