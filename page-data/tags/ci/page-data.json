With how fast technology keeps changing and how quickly libraries and dependencies get re-written, it becomes essential for your application code to be maintained, tested and delivered to users quickly and efficiently. This will usually involve you re-writing some old code, testing your new feature and then deploying to users for them to enjoy your new feature in your application.</p>\n<p>Obviously this is not usually easy in Android development as the ecosystem is vast and development can be sometimes slow, especially when you have to deal with recompiling and rebuilding a project every time there is a change you have made to your code (honestly, do not like this part of the job). The even bigger challenge comes when you have to create a release, sign it and manually deploy it on PlayStore. This process becomes even more tedious!</p>\n<p>The good thing is there are many Continuous Integration and Deployment providers that take away the manual process of things and make it more automatic, so that you only deal with the writing of code and they deal with the deployment of the product.</p>\n<p>You will find a lot of these tools used for web projects, OS images servers, but not so much for mobile applications, yet the delivery is more or less the same. Luckily these same tools can be used to deploy your mobile applications and today you shall learn how.</p>\n<h3>A couple of things</h3>\n<p>There are a couple of things that I need to mention before I proceed.</p>\n<p>First, the examples I shall use will be referencing <a href=\"https://circleci.com/\">CircleCI</a>, but does not mean that they can only be used with CircleCI, any CI provider will do the trick.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I assume that you already have a test setup for you Android application and also an Android application you are working on.</p>\n<p>Third, I also assume that you have a PlayStore developer account where you will deploy your application.</p>\n<p>Whether you have these setup or not, the following will prove to be helpful for you down the line.</p>\n<h3>Getting started and setting up.</h3>\n<p>Assuming you already have a working Android project with which you need to automate the boring stuff of testing and deployment, there are a couple of things you will need to have to make the process even smoother.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Gradle properties file</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Think of this as a file you, your team and your CI should only know about. This is normally labelled as <code>gradle.properties</code> file and contains API keys, Secret Keys and Base URls that your application uses when communicating with a service provider.</p>\n<p>This file should not be checked into a VCS(Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc) as you do not want to expose these secret keys to the public. But if they are not checked into a VCS, then how will your CI know how to build your application properly?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-properties\">DEV_API_BASE_URL=&#x3C;YOUR_DEV_BASE_URL>\nAPI_BASE_URL=&#x3C;YOUR_BASE_URL>\nAPI_KEY=&#x3C;YOUR_API_KEY>\nGITHUB_TOKEN=&#x3C;YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>\nSERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=&#x3C;YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>\nVERSION_NAME=1.0.0\nVERSION_CODE=1\nRELEASE_TRACK=beta\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A typical generic <code>gradle.properties</code> file with secret keys and what not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These configurations assume you have such values in your application. The only values that will really be essential to your build environment are <code>VERSION_CODE</code>, <code>VERSION_NAME</code> and <code>RELEASE_TRACK</code>.</p>\n<p>Version code and name are used as unique identifiers for your application when deploying on playstore while release track is used to identify which track your current release will be published on(either beta, alpha or production).</p>\n<p>I prefer setting the track to beta, so as to enable the current release to be first pushed to beta testers before it is upgraded to production. Also beta track is what I use when building from <code>develop</code> or <code>staging</code> branch, which ensures that the master branch will only be used for <code>production</code> releases.</p>\n<p>Here is how we can generate the <code>RELEASE_TRACK</code> value dynamically:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-properties\">/**\n * Gets the release track to use for deployment\n * Release tracks are either \"alpha\", \"beta\", \"production\", \"rollout\"\n * */\ndef getReleaseTrack = { ->\n    try{\n        Properties properties = new Properties()\n        properties.load(new FileInputStream(\"gradle.properties\"))\n        return Integer.parseInt(properties.getProperty(\"RELEASE_TRACK\"))\n    }catch (ignored){\n        return \"alpha\"\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This will get the release track from the properties file and if it can not get that from the file, then the default is alpha release track. This ensure that we do not touch the production/rollout tracks and leave that up to the CI to handle when the build and tests succeeds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And to even make it more dynamic we can create a shell script that the CI handles before building the application</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># updates the version code based on the current branch\nfunction updateVersionCodeAndTrack(){\n    versionCode=$(git rev-list --first-parent --count origin/${CIRCLE_BRANCH})\n    versionName=$(git describe --dirty)\n\n#    if [\"${versionName}\" == \"fatal: No names found, cannot describe anything.\"]; then\n#        major=$(expr ${CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM} - ${CIRCLE_PREVIOUS_BUILD_NUM})\n#        versionName=${major}.0.0\n#    fi\n\n    if [\"${versionName}\" == \"fatal: No names found, cannot describe anything.\"]; then\n        versionName=1.0.0\n    fi\n\n    if [ \"${CIRCLE_BRANCH}\" == \"develop\" ]; then\n        echo \"VERSION_NAME=${versionName}\" >> ${GRADLE_PROPERTIES}\n        echo \"VERSION_CODE=${versionCode}\" >> ${GRADLE_PROPERTIES}\n        echo \"RELEASE_TRACK=\\\"beta\\\"\" >> ${GRADLE_PROPERTIES}\n\n    elif [ \"${CIRCLE_BRANCH}\" == \"master\" ] ; then\n        echo \"VERSION_NAME=${versionName}\" >> ${GRADLE_PROPERTIES}\n        echo \"VERSION_CODE=${versionCode}\" >> ${GRADLE_PROPERTIES}\n        echo \"RELEASE_TRACK=\\\"production\\\"\" >> ${GRADLE_PROPERTIES}\n    fi\n}\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, the release track is updated according to the branch the CI is running on. ${GRADLE_PROPERTIES} is simply the location of the <code>gradle.properties</code> file.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>KeyStore</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Android applications have to be signed in order for PlayStore to accept your release APK. This is a simple file (with a .jks extension) that authenticates your application with PlayStore. It is a MUST have when creating releases, otherwise PlayStore will not let your application into the <em>Pearly Gates</em> that is Google PlayStore.</p>\n<p>To create a KeyStore file, simply follow instructions outlined <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#generate-key\">here</a> and when you are done, come back here with your new shiny keystore file and we can proceed.</p>\n<p>Once you have your File in place, we can now automate the signing of the application easily.</p>\n<p>This file is not pushed to Github and as such means that your CI has be be aware of its <code>existence</code> and build your application as you would locally. but how would it go about this process?</p>\n<p>We start off by creating a <code>keystore.properties</code> file.

This will be found at the root of your project tree. The update we make will be used to extract information from your <code>keystore.properties</code> file and be used to sign your application</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-properties\">/**\n * Get version code from git history\n * This will dynamically increase the version code\n * If it fails to get from git, it will get it from the properties file, ensure that there is a properties\n * file at root of project\n * */\ndef getVersionCode = { ->\n    try{\n        def stdout = new ByteArrayOutputStream()\n        exec {\n            commandLine \"git\", \"rev-list\", \"--first-parent\", \"--count\", \"origin/master\"\n            standardOutput = stdout\n        }\n        Random random = new Random()\n\n        // this ensures that the version code remains unique for every build\n        def number = random.nextInt(10) + random.nextInt(5) * random.nextInt(7) + random.nextInt(4)\n        return Integer.parseInt(stdout.toString().trim()) + number\n    }catch (ignored){\n        Properties properties = new Properties()\n        properties.load(new FileInputStream(\"gradle.properties\"))\n        return Integer.parseInt(properties.getProperty(\"VERSION_CODE\"))\n    }\n}\n\n/**\n * Get version name will ensure that the version name of the application remains unique and ever changing\n * for easier tracking.

This includes release notes, screenshots, whats new section, version name, icons etc.\nOne caveat is that you will have to manually upload the APK to PlayStore the first time, but after that this plugin will handle the automation so that all you have to do is focus on the code and features you create. More on this plugin can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/Triple-T/gradle-play-publisher\">here</a>. This includes setup and how to use it. I advice you read through it and understand before proceeding.</p>\n<h3>CI configuration</h3>\n<p>Once we have all this configured, we can then configure Circle CI config file to automate the process. This will run the build, test the application and deploy to PlayStore based on your configuration settings above.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of scripts that may need to be included to make it much easier for deployment of the application. Remember how I mentioned that it is not good practice for the <code>jks</code> file to be pushed to Github or any VCS you use? Yes, these scripts ensure that the automation is seamless as if it were running on your development machine. I will start off with a couple of things you will need to setup.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Circle CI environment variables</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Start off by setting Circle CI environment variables, These will be used to setup values that are specific for the project and also that will be used by the scripts we will write up.

Refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Automating-Publishing-to-the-Play-Store\">this</a> for more information on this.</p>\n<p>Once you have your JSON file, copy and paste that information as an env variable.</p>\n<p><code>KEY_STORE_URI</code> is, as the suffix suggests, uri location of your keystore file. Considering that you can not (and should not) push this to Github, you should be able to still access this somehow right?</p>\n<p>There is an easy way to do this using DropBox, yes, DropBox. A very simple hack is to upload your keystore file there and create a shareable link for the keystore file. With this, then you should be able to use that link to download the file and create a key store on your CI.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">export STORE_FILE_LOCATION=$HOME\"/app-dir/app.jks\"\n\n# download key store file from remote location\n# keystore URI will be the location uri for the *.jks file for signing application\nfunction downloadKeyStoreFile {\n    # use curl to download a keystore from $KEYSTORE_URI, if set,\n    # to the path/filename set in $KEYSTORE.\n    echo \"Looking for $STORE_FILE_LOCATION ...\"\n\n    if [ !
