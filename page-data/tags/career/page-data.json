It is such a fluid and ever changing world that you can find yourself lost in the pursuit of knowledge.</p>\n<p>Despite this, it is still a pursuit that keeps one growing and learning. These are the most important things when starting out on a journey to learn technology and dive into its depths. Sometimes the journey is full of twists and turns, long nights and early mornings, short weekends and long weekdays, even rough days and good ones, but overall, what makes me most happy is the ability to be able to create something that betters other people's lives. Makes them easier, makes them focus on what is most important in life instead of focusing on the menial tasks that we have the ability to automate.</p>\n<p>I remember when I wrote my first lines of code. I had just finished high school and had a lot of free time on my hands before joining campus (8 months). With this amount of time at one's disposal, it is easy to get lost in all that is happening around without proper planning. I enrolled for the usual classes everyone enrolled for after finishing high shool; Computer classes(Computer package classes, Driving classes, Accounting classes, etc.). I wanted to keep busy, so this gave me the chance to stay out of the house and not lose my mind. Of course all these classes only lasted 4 months, so the extra 4 months was spent attending bootcamps that span 3 weeks or less. It is during that time, that I discovered that one could actually create programs with code.</p>\n<p>The irony of it all was that my curiosity for technology was not inspired at all by attending computer classes, it was in fact inspired by a program that taught people how to type (mostly used by secretaries to train and improve their typing speed). I was curious as to how this simple program knew the keys I typed in and how it measured the speed at which I typed words. It was magic to me. I wanted to understand how it was built, I was <em>waay</em> beyond the why of it all (Improve people's typing speed), I wanted to know <strong>how</strong>.</p>\n<p>So, I dove into Google and typed in <em>how to build a computer program</em>, and waited for the search results to guide me to an answer. Of course, then, there were now sites like <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/\">Udemy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com\">Udacity</a>, <a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com\">Codecademy</a>, etc, so the search was even more difficult. I stumbed upon <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic\">Visual Basic</a> and I began downloading all the required tutorials I needed to understand <strong>how</strong> one builds a program, how to start, what you need, all the required tools that should be at your disposal and I just started.</p>\n<p>Fast forward 3 weeks later, after a lot of trial and error and the first program I built was a simple Trivia which was basically a bunch of <em>if else</em> statements that checked for your answer. I didn't care that it was horrible, looked bad or was slow, I just wanted to build something, to see it used and to understand what it took to build a program that did something and made someone's life better (in this case help you become better at trivia questions). It worked! My first ever program! Too bad there was no way of sharing it with the world (because I had no idea how to). So I explored further into how do people share what they create and how do other people then download and install these programs and that lead me to networking and how the internet works(for some reason also lead me to how viruses work, go figure).</p>\n<p>All this digging around for information made me realize how technology had the potential to change my life as well. I was learning, growing, hungry...for knowledge. I simply wanted to understand, I wanted to know the <strong>why</strong> of it all.</p>\n<p>Technology has had a major positive impact ever since. Being part of teams that build highly scalable applications has not only brought out the best in me, but has also shown me what I still need to learn and what I still need to do to get better.</p>\n<p>A couple of things that I have learned along the way:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Have zero tolerance for the victim mentality</strong>. I have learned to become deliberate about regularly upskiling myself through reading books, learning new skills, meeting and interacting with new people in different fields and industry. Of course, you will not learn everything all at once. There are times where you will fail and will fail hard, it is okay. It is part of the journey. Instead of complaining that it is difficult and hard to understant algorithms and data structures, design patterns and frameworks, take the time to deliberately want to learn and understand that patience is key in this journey.</li>\n<li><strong>Be very deliberate about where you are and understand the opportunity cost of where you are</strong>. Understand your true value including your weaknesses. Focus on up-scaling yourself. Realize that by choosing this, you have foregone other opportunities, that this is the journey you want to be on, this means that you need to make an effort to understand all that comes with it; beyond the code. This means understanding your user(who you are building for) and why you are building it.</li>\n<li><strong>Where you work has a major impact on your work-life harmony</strong>. If you work for a company that re-inforces you and you konow your work will create value, you will remain satisfied and extremely motivated that you hardly feel burn out. This is important especially in a tech field, where there is an ever changing need for how products serve customers, you need to be in a place that gives you the opportunity to balance your work and life in a way that does not sacrfice one for the other. This will leave you wanting and yearning more and will make you happier.</li>\n<li><strong>Realize that technologies are tools used to build products and they are not to be mistaken with the actual product</strong>. A lot of times, developers tend to argue and debate over what is the most popular tool/language to use out there and will tend to make this the most important thing when building an actual product. I understand that developers have their preferences and for good reasons (I included). However, what I have learnt is that treating these preferences as tools instead of an actual product helps you move much more quickly in the industry. Realize that tools are used based on the use-case. You would not use a hammer to cut down a tree, right? Or use a chainsaw sandpaper. Even though you like your hammers, you know you can't use them all the time. So, pick the best tool for the job. The sooner you realize this the faster you can learn and build better products. This will help you to become more diverse and help in exploring posibilities of even building your own tools.</li>\n</ol>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Career"}}}
