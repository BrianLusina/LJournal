Being top of your class does not necessarily guarantee that you will be at the top of life. You could graduate as the best student in finace but it doesn't mean you will make more money thatn everybody else. The best graduating law student does not necessarily make the best lawyer.</p>\n<p>The fact is life requires more than the ability to understand a concept, memoriese it and reproduce it in an exam. School rewards people for their memory, Life rewards people for their imagination.</p>\n<p>School rewards caution, while life rewards daring.\nSchool hails those who live by the rules, byt life exalts those who break the rules and set new ones.</p>\n<p>So, do I mean people should not study hard in school? Oh no! By all means you should. However, don't sacrifice every other thing on the alter of first class.</p>\n<p>Do not limit yourself to the classrorm. Do something practical. Take a leadership position. Start a business and fail. That is a better Entrepreneurship 101.</p>\n<p>Join or start a club. Contest and election and lose. It will teach you something Polition Science 101 will not teach you. Attend a seminar. Read books outside the scope of your corse. Go on missions and win a soul for eternal rewards...Do something you believe in!</p>\n<p>Think less of becoming an excellent student but think more of becoming an excellent person. Make the world your classroom.</p>\n<p>Don't you ever allow the level of education you have become your prision.</p>\n<p>Make the world your classroom! Have an amazing week ahead.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The sins of success","subtitle":"What are the sins of success?","excerpt":"What are the sins of success?","path":"/life/sins-of-success","date":"May 02, 2017","author":{"name":"Brian Lusina","link":"/brian_lusina","avatar":"brian_lusina.jpg"},"image":{"feature":null,"thumbnail":null,"teaser":null,"credit":null,"creditlink":null},"tags":["life","success"]},"excerpt":"We all crave success and that is what we wake up to each morning.

No one wants to wak up each morning and go to bed having failed at certain tasks. Of course we do not always get what we want and that would often mean that we will fail and fall sometimes. Have you ever wondered though how some people seem to always be succeeding every single day and in life itsef?</p>\n<p>Well, it is a little known fact that if you think and act like the 99%, you will never become the 1%. The 1% control a major share of economies and companies and we all want a share of that. They are human like we are, but they seem to be succeeding a whole lot more, why?</p>\n<p><em>You live in a box</em>\n<em>You drive in a box</em>\n<em>One day you will be buried in a box</em>\n<em>Don't live your life in a box</em>\n<em>CRUSH THE BOX!</em></p>\n<p>These people stepped out of the box a long time ago and that is why they just keep pushing the boundaries.\nThey discovered the sins to success. Some of which I shall now disclose.</p>\n<h2>Lie to yourself</h2>\n<p>You are never ready but that is not a good reason to stop. If you wait until you are ready, you will get all the left overs. <strong>YOU ARE NEVER READY</strong>.</p>\n<p>You need to say NO to yourself even if it is a lie. Do things that scare you. If it doesn't scare you, it is too easy.</p>\n<h2>Cheat on everyone and yourself.</h2>\n<p>Great vision requires a lot of focus. To turn your dream into reality, you will have to cheat on everyone and yourself. You will have to say NO to peopl who don't appreciate your time. You will have to say NO to people who don't believe in your dream. Every idea looks bad before you succeed. You will have to say NO to yourself to stay focussed.</p>\n<h2>Steal knowledge</h2>\n<p>At any price, invest in yourself and gather more knowledge. Don't let anything stop you. When someone tells you no, reply with a NO. After all double negatives do make a positive. If you don't allow people to stop you from acquiring knowledge and investing in yourself, you will go far.</p>\n<h2>Kill your own ideas</h2>\n<p>I think the hardest things to say is <em>No, I need to stop</em>. This signifies defeat in most cases and our human nature does not allow us to accept defeat. However, not everything will work out.</p>\n<p>You will need to have the right peopl at the right time and right place. If one of the elements is missing, it doesn't matter how good your idea is, it won't work out.</p>\n<p>A lot of times, the opportunity cost of chasing the wrong dream is the opportunity to turn another dream into reality. You will need to know how to say NO and kil ideas/projects when you need to do it.</p>\n<p>Lie, cheat, steal and kill are the 4 sins of success. You need to know how to say NO in all cases.\n<em>Less is more</em>.\nSay NO a lot.\nSay NO often.\nFocus on less things and do the best you can.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"life"}}}
