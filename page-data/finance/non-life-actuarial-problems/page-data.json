This may be a very common topic when it comes to the insurance sector, but, hey, why not shed some more light on it anyway.</p>\n<p>Insurance is very critical to business and in order for these businesses to keep operating despite calamities, they need insurance to ensure that no matter what happens they can keep their doors open.</p>\n<p>But, this is on the side of businesses and that is entirely different, today I shall shed some light on the fundamental problems of <em>Non life insurance</em> on Insurance companies. Call it flipping the coin and viewing it from the other side.</p>\n<p>This is a high-level view of what I am talking about.</p>\n<p>Actuaries deal with all kinds of mathematical and statistical problems in insurance. Insurance companies accept risks (potential claims) from their clients against a certain price called the premium. If a risk or a portfolio of risks is too large for a company, it will pass parts of it to one or several companies (its <em>re-insurance</em>) and remain with a part of it (its <em>retention</em>). If a risk is very large, some re-insurers pass parts of the acceptances to other companies so that the original risk or portfolio is covered by an entire network of insurers and re-insurance arrangements between a number of companies each of them carrying the retention they deem appropriate. Therefore, the amount of a company retains depend on a lot of things:</p>\n<h3>Capital of a company</h3>\n<p>This is obviously a big deal. A company with a large capital base can afford to retain more on its account than a company with a smaller capital base.</p>\n<h3>Management risk willingness</h3>\n<p>This all depends on the management and their risk appetite. The only question to ask here is <em>is the management willing to take risks?</em>. And this usually leads to, <em>if so, how much?</em>. A manager with a smaller risk appetite will not take as much risk as his/her counterpart. Thus we expect the former to retain less on the company account.</p>\n<h3>Profitability of the company</h3>\n<p>How profitable will be company be in undertaking a risk? We all know that the most basic of any company goal is to make a profit. It's usually hidden under the many missions and visions it share with the public. Internally, the company's main goal is to make a profit.\nThe <em>underwriter</em> needs to set appropriate premiums and assess whether the portfolio will produce a profit given unusual claims are not reported.</p>\n<p>These are just some of the basics and I will ensure to highlight more in days to come.\nIn the meantime, digest this information and comment if you like.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Non Life Insurance Problems in Life","subtitle":"Problems in Non-Life Insurance","date":"January, 16, 2017","author":{"name":"Brian Lusina","link":"/brian_lusina","avatar":"brian_lusina.jpg"},"image":{"feature":"nonlife-insurance-problems.jpg","thumbnail":null,"teaser":"nonlife-insurance-problems.jpg","credit":"Life Marketers","creditlink":"http://www.lifemarketers.com/life-insurance-general-agency/non-med-life-insurance"},"path":"/finance/non-life-actuarial-problems","tags":["Actuarial","Insurance","Money","business"],"excerpt":"Problems in Non-Life Insurance"}}},"pageContext":{"prev":{"html":"<p>Following what I wrote about last <a href=\"https://brianlusina.github.io//money/non-life-actuarial-problems/\">time</a>(feel free to check it out), I will follow up with that and mention briefly the problems General insurance companies usually face when it comes to retaining risk especially when dealing with a portfolio.</p>\n<p>The factors are(for those who are rebels and just will not read my previous article :D), <em>capital a company has</em>, <em>risk willingness</em> and <em>profit margin</em>.

They are very useful concepts that any programmer who knows about Object Oriented Programming (OOP) should grasp and know like the back of their hand. They not only make code readable and testable, but also make your life a hell of a lot easier.</p>\n<p>Alright,let us get to it, so, I shall write about abstraction and interface in the Java programming language. However these very concepts can be applied to any OOP language out there.</p>\n<h2>Abstract classes</h2>\n<p>These are classes that contain one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is one that is declared but contains no implementation (without braces and followed by a semi-colon).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">abstract void drive(double speed);\n</code></pre>\n<p>If a class contains abstract methods then the class <strong>must</strong> be declared abstract. When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class. However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">abstract class Car{\n\n    abstract void changeGear(int number);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Take for example we are modelling animals, we may start the hierachy with a base class of <em>Animal</em>. Animals are capable of several things, flying, running, swimming, crawling. They are also capable of sleeping, eating, dreaming. In this regard, the many types of animals have similar characteristics, like eating and sleeping. So the common operations performed by animals, but in a different way is a good candidate for abstraction which will force the subclasses (or child classes) to provide their own implementation. Let us take the following example.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">    abstract class Animal {\n\n        /**Types of food the animals eat*/\n        public abstract void eat(String food);\n\n        /**How long the anima will sleep*/\n        public void sleep(int hours){\n            try{\n                // 1000 milliseconds * 60 seconds * 60 minutes * hours\n                Thread.sleep(1000 * 60 *60 *hours);\n            }catch (InterruptedException ie){\n                ie.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n\n        /**The sound the animals make*/\n        public abstract void makeNoise();\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <strong>abstract</strong> keyword is used in both the class and the method to declare that the class and the method are abstract. Any class that subclasses <code>Animal</code> must implement the <code>makeNoise</code> and the <code>eat</code> functions.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">    public class Cat extends Animal{\n        @Override\n        public void eat(String food) {\n            System.out.println(\"Cats eat \" + food);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void makeNoise() {\n            System.out.println(\"Cats meow a lot\");\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively we could declare Animal as an interface instead of using an abstract class, and have the Cat implement the interface. You could - but you'd also need to implement the sleep method. By using abstract classes, you can inherit the implementation of other (non-abstract) methods. You can't do that with interfaces - an interface cannot provide any method implementations.</p>\n<h2>Abstract classes and Interfaces</h2>\n<p>Now, that we have a basic understanding of abstraction, we shal compare that to interfaces. What is the difference? They are similar in a way, but are obviously not the same. You <strong>can't</strong> instantiate an abstract class and they may contain a mix of methods containing a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. With abstract classes, you can declare fields that are not static and final, and define public, protected, and private concrete methods. With interfaces on the other hand, all fields are automatically public, static, and final, and all methods that you declare or define (as default methods) are public. In addition, you can extend only one class, whether or not it is abstract, whereas you can implement any number of interfaces (basics of OOP).</p>\n<h2>Instances to use Abstract classes and Interfaces.</h2>\n<p>Abstract classes are best used in such scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You want to share code among several closely related classes.</li>\n<li>You expect that classes that extend your abstract class have many common methods or fields, or require access modifiers other than public (such as protected and private).</li>\n<li>You want to declare non-static or non-final fields. This enables you to define methods that can access and modify the state of the object to which they belong.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Interfaces on the other hand are best used in such scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You expect that unrelated classes would implement your interface.</li>\n<li>You want to specify the behavior of a particular data type, but not concerned about who implements its behavior.</li>\n<li>You want to take advantage of multiple inheritance of type.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These obviously are not the only scenarios, they are just but examples. A real practical example of Abstraction is found <a href=\"https://github.com/BrianLusina/Java-Playground/tree/master/AbstractionInterfaces/MotorVehicles\">here</a>.</p>","id":"65bbf04c-f57d-5914-83d7-79a1e45597a9","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"title":"Abstraction and interfaces","subtitle":"When to use abstraction and when to use interfaces","excerpt":"Abstraction and interfaces are common words that most programmers will come across when desigining systems and platforms.
