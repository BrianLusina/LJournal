I know I have. How do you even acquire the clout &#x26; clamor of a billionaire? Do you learn it over time? Is it natural? Is it passed down through induction? Or is it just for the select few gifted people?</p>\n<p>Well, I can say for a fact that billionaries are just human beings like everyone else, except that they well, you know, have billions and they make money while they sleep. However, if you think about billionaires did not just suddenly start out like that, they must have had a turning point at some point in time or they discovered something that the rest of human kind is always going to crave for.</p>\n<p>What did they discover? What do they do? What don’t they do? Obviously, these are normal men, with normal upbringing &#x26; faced the same challenges as their peers but there came a time when they broke loose from their peers &#x26; ended up where they are.</p>\n<p>Billionaires have 5 things in common that made them be where &#x26; what they are.</p>\n<p>The five things are:</p>\n<h3>1. They Understand The Power Of Many (Numbers.)</h3>\n<p>The richer you are, the more you disassociate self from the business, but the poorer you are, the more you want to identify with your business.</p>\n<p>Successful business people do not have a <em>my business</em> attitued, instead they have a <em>our business idea</em> attitued. That’s why when you go to a fancy 7 star hotel, chances are some employees there do not know who owns the place &#x26; have never seen him/her. But when you go to a poor person’s business, that person is always there, worse even acting as the cashier, accountant, attendant, etc.</p>\n<p>The trick of business success is in numbers not in self. As long as you have a personal business called “mine” then be sure u are headed for poverty. People die but companies outlive them.</p>\n<h3>2. They Are Serious Borrowers.</h3>\n<p>Borrowing money is their cup of tea &#x26; signature. If you have never borrowed money, you will never lend money; &#x26; can't lend it if you don’t have it.</p>\n<p>A bank is a broker between the poor &#x26; the rich. The only place where the you meet is in a bank. The poor bring the money &#x26; the rich take it. A poor person saves money because they have more money than their thinking capacity. So they keep the money there so they can go &#x26; think what to do with it.</p>\n<p>Rich people borrow that very same money because they have more ideas than their money. So they come to pick that money and &#x26; implement those great ideas.</p>\n<p>Only poor people operate savings &#x26; fixed deposit accounts. Fixed deposit accounts are for the living dead. People who undertake &#x26; commit that they will not think about any idea for that money until the expiry of that period of time, otherwise they will be penalized. Rich people operate current accounts. Therefore, a bank exists purposely for 2 reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For the poor to bring in the money</li>\n<li>For the rich to come &#x26; take it away.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Banks make more money from borrowers than savers. Hence they respect the former more.</p>\n<h3>3. They have High Level NETWORKS!</h3>\n<p>These people as explained in the 1st point believe in the power of many. As a result, they have many like-minded friends who can be of benefit to them. They have friends all over. Rich people have no age, tribal, geographical or gender boundaries. It doesn’t matter who or what you are as long as you are of value to their ventures.</p>\n<p>Building such networks needs a lot of travelling &#x26; interacting with people. People never get rich in their hometown. Somebody who dreams of being rich, regardless of their age or status, must have;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Driving license (because they will own a car – its criminal to be seeing cars everyday but never own one.),</li>\n<li>A Passport (because you must travel widely to expand your networks &#x26; sharpen your mindset – If you have been buying a suit in Kenya for Ksh. 30,000) &#x26; find it in China at Ksh. 800, your language &#x26; ideas change)</li>\n<li>You must know how you swim because you are going to have fun &#x26; relax.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. They Are Great Risk Takers!</h3>\n<p>As long as you avoid taking risks, you are headed to the grave poor. Taking risks is like walking in the dark. You know where you are going but can’t see it yet. Better still, you are more confident &#x26; secure when you are accompanied than when alone. The more people you have, the more secure, hence the 1st point.</p>\n<p>Risk taking is about numbers.</p>\n<h3>5. They Have Read The BIBLE!</h3>\n<p>They understand &#x26; make use of the parable of the sower. The seed is the shilling. They put the shilling on fertile land. They simply know where to put their money &#x26; where not to put it.</p>\n<p>They understand the current business trends &#x26; make business decisions with this in mind. If you bought a plot 5 years ago at Ksh. 500,000, you are worth nothing 5 years later except that plot even if it will be worth 2M.</p>\n<p>A rich person will invest that same money somewhere where it will be worth 2B within the same period of time. That’s why you find a 2-bedroom house varying from Ksh. 2,000 to Sh. 80,00 or even more from one place to another.</p>\n<p>Or a cup of tea ranging from 5 shillings to Ksh. 1,000. Yet when you ask all these business people, you will discover that each one of them decided the price. Why the variance?</p>\n<p>They know the value chain. In business the “Higher you go, the cooler it becomes &#x26; the lower the pressure\".</p>\n<p>A landlord collecting 2,000 for a 2-bedroom house has more problems than his colleague collecting 80,000 for the same house elsewhere.</p>\n<p>While one has to literally come collecting payments at 4am every 1st day of the month (lest the tenant escapes), the other’s money is safely banked in his account even before the month ends. While one can even bargain with the tenant about the rent, the other is fixed, &#x26; u either take it or leave it.</p>\n<p>While one, regardless of the cheap rent has few tenants, the other has a problem of too many tenants coming to look for housing.</p>\n<p>Same with the tea business. The one worth 5 shillings comes in a bigger cup than the one worth 200 times that.</p>\n<p>You should know where to put your money. Create value for your cash, don’t battle with market prices. They are not your limit.</p>\n<p>It's better to be the last among the rich than to be the 1st among the poor.</p>\n<p>A Poor (POOR) Person Is One Who <em>Passes Over Opportunities Repeatedly.</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"5 Attributes of billionaires","subtitle":"5 attributes you should probably start adopting.","date":"May, 06, 2017","author":{"name":"Brian Lusina","link":"/brian_lusina","avatar":"brian_lusina.jpg"},"image":{"feature":null,"thumbnail":null,"teaser":null,"credit":null,"creditlink":null},"path":"/finance/want-to-be-rich","tags":["Finance","Wealth","Money","business"],"excerpt":"5 attributes you should probably start adopting."}}},"pageContext":{"prev":{"html":"<p>Academic excellence is overrated!

No one wants to wak up each morning and go to bed having failed at certain tasks. Of course we do not always get what we want and that would often mean that we will fail and fall sometimes. Have you ever wondered though how some people seem to always be succeeding every single day and in life itsef?</p>\n<p>Well, it is a little known fact that if you think and act like the 99%, you will never become the 1%. The 1% control a major share of economies and companies and we all want a share of that. They are human like we are, but they seem to be succeeding a whole lot more, why?</p>\n<p><em>You live in a box</em>\n<em>You drive in a box</em>\n<em>One day you will be buried in a box</em>\n<em>Don't live your life in a box</em>\n<em>CRUSH THE BOX!</em></p>\n<p>These people stepped out of the box a long time ago and that is why they just keep pushing the boundaries.\nThey discovered the sins to success. Some of which I shall now disclose.</p>\n<h2>Lie to yourself</h2>\n<p>You are never ready but that is not a good reason to stop. If you wait until you are ready, you will get all the left overs. <strong>YOU ARE NEVER READY</strong>.</p>\n<p>You need to say NO to yourself even if it is a lie. Do things that scare you. If it doesn't scare you, it is too easy.</p>\n<h2>Cheat on everyone and yourself.</h2>\n<p>Great vision requires a lot of focus. To turn your dream into reality, you will have to cheat on everyone and yourself. You will have to say NO to peopl who don't appreciate your time. You will have to say NO to people who don't believe in your dream. Every idea looks bad before you succeed. You will have to say NO to yourself to stay focussed.</p>\n<h2>Steal knowledge</h2>\n<p>At any price, invest in yourself and gather more knowledge. Don't let anything stop you. When someone tells you no, reply with a NO. After all double negatives do make a positive. If you don't allow people to stop you from acquiring knowledge and investing in yourself, you will go far.</p>\n<h2>Kill your own ideas</h2>\n<p>I think the hardest things to say is <em>No, I need to stop</em>. This signifies defeat in most cases and our human nature does not allow us to accept defeat. However, not everything will work out.</p>\n<p>You will need to have the right peopl at the right time and right place. If one of the elements is missing, it doesn't matter how good your idea is, it won't work out.</p>\n<p>A lot of times, the opportunity cost of chasing the wrong dream is the opportunity to turn another dream into reality. You will need to know how to say NO and kil ideas/projects when you need to do it.</p>\n<p>Lie, cheat, steal and kill are the 4 sins of success. You need to know how to say NO in all cases.\n<em>Less is more</em>.\nSay NO a lot.\nSay NO often.\nFocus on less things and do the best you can.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>","id":"70a76c74-375b-5481-a005-41f2bffaed5e","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"The sins of success","subtitle":"What are the sins of success?","excerpt":"What are the sins of success?","path":"/life/sins-of-success","category":"life","date":"May 02, 2017","author":{"name":"Brian Lusina","link":"/brian_lusina","avatar":"brian_lusina.jpg"},"image":{"feature":null,"thumbnail":null,"teaser":null,"credit":null,"creditlink":null},"tags":["life","success"],"published":true}}}}}
