It is developed by Armin Ronacher, who leads an international group of Python enthusiasts named Pocco. Flask is based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. Both are Pocco projects.</p>\n<h3>Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)</h3>\n<p>WSGI has been adopted as a standard for Python web application development. It is a specification for a universal interface between the web server and the web applications.</p>\n<h3>Werkzeug</h3>\n<p>It is a WSGI toolkit, which implements requests, response objects, and other utility functions. This enables building a web framework on top of it. The Flask framework uses Werkzeug as one of its bases.</p>\n<h3>Jinja2</h3>\n<p>Jinja2 is a popular templating engine for Python. A web templating system combines a template with a certain data source to render dynamic web pages.</p>\n<p>Flask is often referred to as a micro framework. It aims to keep the core of an application simple yet extensible. Flask does not have built-in abstraction layer for database handling, nor does it have form a validation support. Instead, Flask supports the extensions to add such functionality to the application.</p>\n<p>{% include toc.html %}</p>\n<h2>Flask Environment</h2>\n<p>Python 2.6 or higher is usually required for installation of Flask. Although Flask and its dependencies work well with Python 3 (Python 3.3 onwards), many Flask extensions do not support it properly. Hence, it is recommended that Flask should be installed on Python 2.7.</p>\n<p>First, you will need to install virtualenv for development environment. Virtualenv is a virtual Python environment builder. It helps a user to create multiple Python environments side-by-side. Thereby, it can avoid compatibility issues between the different versions of the libraries.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">pip install virtualenv\n</code></pre>\n<p>The output should be like this −</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">Collecting virtualenv\n  Downloading virtualenv-15.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (1.8MB)\n\n    100% |################################| 1.8MB 204kB/s\nInstalling collected packages: virtualenv\nSuccessfully installed virtualenv-15.0.1\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command needs administrator privileges. Add sudo before pip on Linux/Mac OS. If you are on Windows, log in as Administrator. On Ubuntu virtualenv may be installed using its package manager.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">Sudo apt-get install virtualenv\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once installed, new virtual environment is created in a folder.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mkdir newproj\ncd newproj\nvirtualenv venv\n</code></pre>\n<p>To activate corresponding environment, on Linux/OS X, use the following −</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">venv/bin/activate\n</code></pre>\n<p>We are now ready to install Flask in this environment.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">pip install Flask\n</code></pre>\n<p>The output should be like this.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">Collecting Flask\n  Downloading Flask-0.10.1.tar.gz (544kB)\n    100% |################################| 544kB 410kB/s\nCollecting Werkzeug>=0.7 (from Flask)\n  Downloading Werkzeug-0.11.4-py2.py3-none-any.whl (305kB)\n    100% |################################| 307kB 531kB/s\nCollecting Jinja2>=2.4 (from Flask)\n  Downloading Jinja2-2.8-py2.py3-none-any.whl (263kB)\n    100% |################################| 266kB 935kB/s\nCollecting itsdangerous>=0.21 (from Flask)\n  Downloading itsdangerous-0.24.tar.gz (46kB)\n    100% |################################| 49kB 1.6MB/s\nCollecting MarkupSafe (from Jinja2>=2.4->Flask)\n  Downloading MarkupSafe-0.23.tar.gz\nInstalling collected packages: Werkzeug, MarkupSafe, Jinja2, itsdangerous, Flask\n  Running setup.py install for MarkupSafe\n  Running setup.py install for itsdangerous\n  Running setup.py install for Flask\nSuccessfully installed Flask-0.10.1 Jinja2-2.8 MarkupSafe-0.23 Werkzeug-0.11.4 itsdangerous-0.24\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above command can be run directly, without virtual environment for system-wide installation.</p>\n<h2>Application</h2>\n<p>In order to test Flaks installation install, you could type the following code in your Python editor as name.py. Here <em>name</em> could be any word. I called mine flasky.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef flask_world():\nreturn 'Welcome to Flasky!'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\napp.run()\n</code></pre>\n<p>A couple of things to note from the above snippet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Importing <code>flask</code> module is necessary and important. The object Flask class is our WSGI application.</li>\n<li>Flask constructor takes the name of current module (<strong>name</strong>) as argument.</li>\n<li>The <code>route()</code> function of the Flask class is a <em>decorator</em>, which tells the application which URL should call the associated function.</li>\n<li>Finally the <code>run()</code> method of Flask class runs the application on the local development server.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Functions to note</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>app.route(rule, options)</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>The rule parameter represents the URL for the function to open</li>\n<li>The options parameter is a list of parameters to be forwarded to the underlying Rule object\nIn the above example, <strong>‘/’</strong> URL is bound with <strong>flask_world()</strong> function. Hence, when the home page of web server is opened in browser, the output of this function will be rendered. This will be a simple text \"Welcome to Flasky!\".</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>app.run(host, port, debug, options)</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All these parameters are optional</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>host</strong>: Hostname to listen on. Defaults to 127.0.0.1 (localhost). Set to ‘0.0.0.0’ to have server available externally.</li>\n<li><strong>port</strong>: Defaults to 5000.</li>\n<li><strong>debug</strong>: Defaults to false. If set to true, provides a debug information.</li>\n<li><strong>options</strong>: To be forwarded to underlying Werkzeug server.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To execute the above snippet simply go to your terminal and go to the directory that holds the project and type in</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">python flasky.py\n</code></pre>\n<p>You will recieve the following information</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Open the above URL (localhost:5000) in the browser. ‘Welcome to Flasky!’ message will be displayed on it.</p>\n<h3>Debug mode</h3>\n<p>A Flask application is started by calling the run() method. However, while the application is under development, it should be restarted manually for each change in the code. To avoid this inconvenience, enable debug support. The server will then reload itself if the code changes. It will also provide a useful debugger to track the errors if any, in the application.</p>\n<p>The Debug mode is enabled by setting the debug property of the application object to True before running or passing the debug parameter to the run() method.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">app.debug = True\napp.run()\napp.run(debug = True)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Routing</h2>\n<p>Modern web frameworks use the routing technique to help a user remember application URLs. It is useful to access the desired page directly without having to navigate from the home page.</p>\n<p>The <code>route()</code> decorator in Flask is used to bind URL to a function. For example −</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/flasky-closet')\ndef flasky_closet():\n   return 'This is what flasky likes to wear.'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, URL <code>'/flasky-closet'</code> rule is bound to the <code>flasky_closet()</code> function. As a result, if a user visits <a href=\"http://localhost:5000/flasky-closet\">http://localhost:5000/flasky-closet</a> URL, the output of the <code>flasky_closet()</code> function will be rendered in the browser. In this case a text <code>This is what flasky likes to wear.</code></p>\n<p>Alternatively, the <code>add_url_rule()</code> function of an application object is also available to bind a URL with a function as in the above example, <code>route()</code> is used.</p>\n<p>A decorator’s purpose is also served by the following representation −</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def flasky_closet():\n   return 'This is what flasky likes to wear.'\napp.add_url_rule('/', 'flasky-closet', flasky)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Variable Rules</h2>\n<p>It is possible to build a URL dynamically, by adding variable parts to the rule parameter. This variable part is marked as <variable-name>. It is passed as a keyword argument to the function with which the rule is associated.</p>\n<p>In the following example, the rule parameter of <code>route()</code> decorator contains <code>&#x3C;name></code> variable part attached to URL <code>/flasky-says-hello</code>. Hence, if the <a href=\"http://localhost:5000/flasky-says-hello/Lusina\">http://localhost:5000/flasky-says-hello/Lusina</a> is entered as a URL in the browser, 'Lusina' will be supplied to <code>flasky_greet()</code> function as argument.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/flasky-says-hello/&#x3C;name>')\ndef flaksy_greet(name):\n   return 'Flasky says hello %s!' % name\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n   app.run(debug = True)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Running above script from the Python shell and opening the browser with URL <a href=\"http://localhost:5000/flasky-say-hello/Lusina\">http://localhost:5000/flasky-say-hello/Lusina</a></p>\n<p>The following output will be displayed in the browser.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Flasky says hello Lusina!</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the default string variable part, rules can be constructed using the following converters −</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>int</strong> accepts integer</li>\n<li><strong>float</strong> For floating point value</li>\n<li><strong>path</strong> accepts slashes used as directory separator character</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/flasky-age/&#x3C;int:postID>')\ndef flasky_age(postID):\n    return 'Flasky just turned  %d' % postID\n\n\n@app.route('/flasky-version/&#x3C;float:revNo>')\ndef flasky_version(revNo):\n    return 'Flasky version %f' % revNo\n</code></pre>\n<p>Running the above code from Python Shell. Visit the URL <a href=\"http://localhost:5000/flasky-age/11\">http://localhost:5000/flasky-age/11</a> in the browser.\nThe given number is used as argument to the flasky_age() function. The browser displays the following output:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Flasky just turned 11</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Enter this URL in the browser − <a href=\"http://localhost:5000/flasky-version/1.1\">http://localhost:5000/flasky-version/1.1</a></p>\n<p>The flasky_version() function takes up the floating point number as argument. The following result appears in the browser window −</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Flasky version 1.100000</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The URL rules of Flask are based on Werkzeug’s routing module. This ensures that the URLs formed are unique and based on precedents laid down by Apache.</p>\n<p>Consider the rules defined in the following script −</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/flask')\ndef hello_flask():\n   return 'Hello Flask'\n\n@app.route('/python/')\ndef hello_python():\n   return 'Hello Python'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n   app.run()\n```python\n\nBoth the rules appear similar but in the second rule, trailing slash (/) is used. As a result, it becomes a canonical URL. Hence, using /python or /python/ returns the same output. However, in case of the first rule, /flask/ URL results in 404 Not Found page.\n\n## URL Building\n\nThe `url_for()` function is very useful for dynamically building a URL for a specific function. The function accepts the name of a function as first argument, and one or more keyword arguments, each corresponding to the variable part of URL.\n\nThe below code is a small snippet demonstrating the same, it builds on the previous snippets.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, redirect, url_for\n# some code\n...\n\n\"\"\"\nusing url_for and redirect to redirect the user in case they are not admin, for instance\nthe flasky_admin function is the admin site\n\"\"\"\n\n\n@app.route('/admin')\ndef flasky_admin():\n    return 'Hello, welcome to the admin page. Admin privileges!'\n\n\"\"\"\nbelow function is the guest site\n\"\"\"\n\n\n@app.route('/guest/&#x3C;guest>')\ndef flasky_guest(guest):\n    return 'Hello %s, You are logged in as guest in Flasky\\'s world' % guest\n\n\n\"\"\"\nbelow function checks the user, if they are admin, they will be redirected to the admin site,\nif they are guests, they will be redirected to the guest site. t\nThis function acts as a validator based on the parameter passed in, in this case, based on the url typed in,\nit will redirect to the relevant function based on the input\n\"\"\"\n\n\n@app.route('/user/&#x3C;name>')\ndef flasky_user(name):\n    if name == 'admin':\n        return redirect(url_for('flasky_admin'))\n    else:\n        return redirect(url_for('flasky_guest', guest=name))\n\n#  other code\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above script has a function <code>flasky_user(name)</code> which accepts a value to its argument from the URL. This function checks if an argument received matches <code>admin</code> or not. If it matches, the application is redirected to the <code>flasky_admin()</code> function using <code>url_for()</code>, otherwise to the <code>flasky_guest()</code> function passing the received argument as guest parameter to it.</p>\n<p>On running the above code, this is the output when the url is <strong><a href=\"http://localhost:5000/admin\">http://localhost:5000/admin</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello, welcome to the admin page. Admin privileges!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the url is changed to <a href=\"http://localhost:5000/guest/Meme\">http://localhost:5000/guest/Meme</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello Meme, You are logged in as guest in Flasky's world</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>HTTP methods</h2>\n<p>The following table is a summary of the HTTP methods availaible:\n| Method | Description\n|---|\n| GET | Sends data in unencrypted form to the server. Most common method.\n| POST | Used to send HTML form data to server. Data received by POST method is not cached by server.\n| HEAD | Same as GET, but without response body\n| PUT | Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content\n| DELETE| Removes all current representations of the target resouce given by URL</p>\n<p>By default, the Flask route responds to the <em>GET</em> requests. However, this preference can be altered by providing methods argument to <code>route()</code> decorator.</p>\n<p>In order to demonstrate the use of <code>POST</code> method in URL routing, first let us create an HTML form and use the POST method to send form data to a URL.</p>\n<p>Save the following script as login.html</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;html>\n   &#x3C;body>\n      &#x3C;form action = \"http://localhost:5000/Login\" method = \"post\">\n         &#x3C;p>Enter Name:&#x3C;/p>\n         &#x3C;p>&#x3C;input type = \"text\" name = \"nm\" />&#x3C;/p>\n         &#x3C;p>&#x3C;input type = \"submit\" value = \"submit\" />&#x3C;/p>\n      &#x3C;/form>\n   &#x3C;/body>\n&#x3C;/html>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The following demonstrate HTTP requests. The first function, <code>success(name)</code> is only called when the user is successful in logging in. The <code>request</code> module has to be imported.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for, request\n\n@app.route('/success/&#x3C;name>')\ndef success(name):\n    return 'welcome to Flasky! %s' % name\n</code></pre>\n<p>This below function redirects the user to the login page, The <code>app.route</code> decorator takes in two arguments, the /Login page url and the HTTP methods. It checks the HTTP requests, if the request is POST, <a href=\"http://localhost/login\">http://localhost/login</a> is mapped to the <code>login()</code> function. Since the server has received data by POST method, value of <code>nm</code> parameter obtained from the form data is obtained by −</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>user = request.form['nm']</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is then passed to <code>/success</code> URL as variable part. The browser displays a welcome message in the window.</p>\n<p>Changing the method parameter to ‘GET’ in login.html and opening it again in the browser will cause the data recieved on server by the GET method. The value of <code>nm</code> parameter is now obtained by</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>User = request.args.get(‘nm’)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here, args is dictionary object containing a list of pairs of form parameter and its corresponding value. The value corresponding to <code>nm</code> parameter is passed on to <code>/success</code> URL as before.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/login', methods=['POST', 'GET'])\ndef login():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        user = request.form['nm']\n        return redirect(url_for('success', name=user))\n    else:\n        user = request.args.get('nm')\n        return redirect(url_for('success', name=user))\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Templates</h2>\n<p>It is possible to return the output of a function bound to a certain URL in the form of HTML. For instance, in the following script, <code>hello()</code> function will render ‘Hello World’ with <h1> tag attached to it.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n   return '&#x3C;html>&#x3C;body>&#x3C;h1>Hello World'&#x3C;/h1>&#x3C;/body>&#x3C;/html>'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n   app.run(debug = True)\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, generating HTML content from Python code is cumbersome, especially when variable data and Python language elements like conditionals or loops need to be put. This would require frequent escaping from HTML.</p>\n<p>This is where one can take advantage of <strong><a href=\"http://jinja.pocoo.org/\">Jinja2</a></strong> template engine, on which Flask is based. Instead of returning hardcode HTML from the function, a HTML file can be rendered by the <code>render_template()</code> function.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n   return render_template(‘hello.html’)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n   app.run(debug = True)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Flask will try to find the HTML file in the templates folder, in the same folder in which this script is present.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">├── App-Folder\n|    ├── flasky.py\n|    ├── templates\n|           ├── index.html\n</code></pre>\n<p>The term <em>web templating system</em> refers to designing an HTML script in which the variable data can be inserted dynamically. A web template system comprises of a template engine, some kind of data source and a template processor.</p>\n<p>Flask uses <em>Jinja2</em> template engine. A web template contains HTML syntax interspersed placeholders for variables and expressions (in this case Python expressions) which are replaced values when the template is rendered.</p>\n<p>The following code is saved as hello.html in the templates folder.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;!doctype html>\n&#x3C;html>\n   &#x3C;body>\n      &#x3C;h1>Hello {{ name }}&#x3C;/h1>\n   &#x3C;/body>\n&#x3C;/html>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, run the following script from Python shell.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask, render_template\n\napp = Flask (__name__)} %}\n\n@app.route(\"/hello/&#x3C;user>\")\ndef hello_name(user):\n   return render_template('hello.html', name = user)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n   app.run(debug = True)\n</code></pre>\n<p>As the development server starts running, open the browser and enter URL as − <a href=\"http://localhost:5000/hello/Lusina\">http://localhost:5000/hello/Lusina</a></p>\n<p>The variable part of URL is inserted at <code>{{ name }}</code> place holder.</p>\n<p>The Jinja2 template engine uses the following delimiters for escaping from HTML.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>{\\%\\ ... \\%\\}</code> for Statements</li>\n<li><code>{{ ... }}</code> for Expressions to print to the template output</li>\n<li><code>{# ... #}</code> for Comments not included in the template output</li>\n<li><code># ... ##</code> for Line Statements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the following example, use of conditional statement in the template is demonstrated. The URL rule to the hello() function accepts the integer parameter. It is passed to the hello.html template.

Usually, the web server is configured to serve them for you, but during the development, these files are served from static folder in your package or next to your module and it will be available at /static on the application.</p>\n<p>A special endpoint ‘static’ is used to generate URL for static files.</p>\n<p>In the following example, a javascript function defined in hello.js is called on OnClick event of HTML button in index.html, which is rendered on ‘/’ URL of the Flask application.</p>\n<p>from flask import Flask, render_template</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">        app = Flask(__name__)\n\n        @app.route(\"/\")\n        def index():\n           return render_template(\"index.html\")\n\n        if __name__ == '__main__':\n           app.run(debug = True)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The HTML script of index.html is given below.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">        &#x3C;html>\n           &#x3C;head>\n              &#x3C;script type = \"text/javascript\" src = \"{{ url_for('static', filename = hello.js') }}\" >&#x3C;/script>\n           &#x3C;/head>\n       &#x3C;body>\n          &#x3C;input type = \"button\" onclick = \"sayHello()\" value = \"Say Hello\" />\n       &#x3C;/body>\n        &#x3C;/html>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Hello.js contains sayHello() function.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function sayHello() {\n  alert('Hello World')\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Request Object</h2>\n<p>The data from a client’s web page is sent to the server as a global request object. In order to process the request data, it should be imported from the Flask module.</p>\n<p>Important attributes of request object are listed below:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Request Object</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Form</td>\n<td>It is a dictionary object containing key and value pairs of form parameters and their values.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>args</td>\n<td>parsed contents of query string which is part of URL after question mark (?).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cookies</td>\n<td>dictionary object holding Cookie names and values.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>files</td>\n<td>data pertaining to uploaded file.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Sending Form Data to Template</h2>\n<p>We have seen that the http method can be specified in URL rule. The Form data received by the triggered function can collect it in the form of a <em>dictionary</em> object and forward it to a template to render it on a corresponding web page.</p>\n<p>In the following example, <code>/</code> URL renders a web page <code>login-sample.html</code> which has a form. The data filled in it is posted to the <code>/result</code> URL which triggers the <code>result()</code> function.</p>\n<p>The <code>results()</code> function collects form data present in <code>request.form</code> in a dictionary object and sends it for rendering to <code>success.html</code></p>\n<p>The template dynamically renders an HTML table of form data.</p>\n<p>These are the sample html forms and tables that will be used fot this small exercise</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;!--sample form for login sample-->\n&#x3C;form action = \"http://localhost:5000/success\" method = \"POST\">\n    &#x3C;p>Name &#x3C;input type = \"text\" name = \"Name\" />&#x3C;/p>\n     &#x3C;p>Email &#x3C;input type = \"email\" name = \"Email\" />&#x3C;/p>\n    &#x3C;p>username &#x3C;input type = \"text\" name = \"username\" />&#x3C;/p>\n     &#x3C;p>Password &#x3C;input type =\"password\" name = \"Password\" />&#x3C;/p>\n     &#x3C;p>&#x3C;input type = \"submit\" value = \"submit\" />&#x3C;/p>\n&#x3C;/form>\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Login page</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;table border = 1>\n     {\\%\\ for key, value in result.iteritems() \\%\\}\n\n        &#x3C;tr>\n           &#x3C;th> {{ key }} &#x3C;/th>\n           &#x3C;td> {{ value }} &#x3C;/td>\n        &#x3C;/tr>\n\n     {\\%\\ endfor \\%\\}\n&#x3C;/table>\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>success page</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Python code</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/login-sample')\ndef user():\n    return render_template('login-sample.html')\n\n\n@app.route('/success', methods=['POST', 'GET'])\ndef success_login():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        result = request.form\n        return render_template('success.html', result=result)\n    else:\n        render_template('404')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n</code></pre>","id":"657e5053-4e32-55ec-affd-25a9a4107f47","timeToRead":17,"frontmatter":{"title":"Flask Web Framework","subtitle":"Some basic information about Flask web framework","excerpt":"Web Application Framework or simply Web Framework represents a collection of libraries and modules that enables a web application developer to write applications without having to bother about low-level details such as protocols, thread management etc.","path":"/tech/flask-webframework","category":"tech","date":"July 30, 2016","author":{"name":"Brian Lusina","link":"/brian_lusina","avatar":"brian_lusina.jpg"},"image":{"feature":"flask-webframe.png","thumbnail":null,"teaser":"flask-webframe.png","credit":"Flask","creditlink":"http://flask.pocoo.org"},"tags":["web frameworks","python frameworks","flask"],"published":true}},"next":{"html":"<p>The whole point of the big-O/Ω/Θ stuff was to be able to say something useful about algorithms.\nSo, let's return to some algorithms and see if we learned anything.\nConsider this simple procedure that sums a list (of numbers, we assume):\nprocedure sum(list)\ntotal = 0\nfor i from 0 to length(list)-1\ntotal += list[i]\nreturn total\nFirst: is the algorithm correct? Does it solve the problem specified?\nSecond: is it fast?\nTo evaluate the running time of an algorithm, we will simply ask how many “steps” it takes.\nIn this case, we can count the number of times it runs the += line.\nFor a list with (n) elements, it takes (n) steps.\nOr is counting the += line the right thing to do?\nWhen implementing the for loop, each iteration requires an add (for the loop index) and a comparison (to check the exit condition). We should count those.\nAlso, the variable initialization and return steps.\nSo, (3n+2) steps.\nBut, not all of those steps are the same.\nHow long does an x86 ADD instruction take compared to a CMP or RET instruction?\nWill the compiler keep both i and total in registers, or will one/both be in RAM? (A factor of ~10 difference.)\nHow do those instructions interact in the pipeline? Which can be sent through parallel pipelines in the processor and executed concurrently?\nThe answer to those is simple: I don't know and you don't either.\nThat's part of the reason we're asking about algorithms, not programs.\nBut both (n) and (3n+2) are perfectly reasonable proposals for the answer.\nDeciding between them requires more knowledge about the actual implementation details than we have.\nGood thing we have the function growth notation.\nRemember: this is easy for (n=5) elements. A good or bad algorithm will both be fast then.\nWe want to know how the algorithm behaves for large (n).\nFinally our answer: the sum procedure has running time (\\Theta(n)).\nWe'll say that this algorithm has time complexity (\\Theta(n)), or “runs in linear time”.\nBoth (n) and (3n+2) are (\\Theta(n)), and so is any other “exact” formula we could come up with.\nThe easy answer (count the += line) was just as correct as the very careful one.\nThe big-Θ notation hides all of the details we can't figure out anyway.\nAnother example: print out the sum of each two numbers in a list.\nThat is, given the list [1,2,3,4,5], we want to find 1+2, 1+3, 1+4, 1+5, 2+3, 2+4,….\nPseudocode:\nprocedure sum<em>pairs(list)\nfor i from 0 to length(list)-2\nfor j from i+1 to length(list)-1\nprint list[i] + list[j]\nFor a list with (n) elements, the for j loop iterates (n-1) times when it is called with i==0, then (n-2) times, then (n-3) times,…\nSo, the total number of times the print step runs is [\\begin{align\\</em>} (n-1)+(n-2)+\\cdots+2+1 &#x26;= \\sum<em>{k=1}^{n-1} k\\ &#x26;= \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\ &#x26;= \\frac{n^2}{2}-\\frac{n}{2},. \\end{align\\</em>}]\nIf we had counted the initialization of the for loops, counter incrementing, etc, we might have come up with something more like (\\frac{3}{2}n^2 + \\frac{1}{2}n + 1).\nEither way, the answer we give is that it takes (\\Theta(n^2)) steps.\nOr, the algorithm “has time complexity (\\Theta(n^2))” or “has (\\Theta(n^2)) running time” or “has quadratic running time”.\nThe lesson: when counting running time, you can be a bit sloppy.\nWe only need to worry about the inner-most loop(s), not the number of steps in there, or work in the outer levels.\n… because they are going to disappear anyway as constant factors and lower-order terms when they go into a big-O/Ω/Θ anyway.\nAverage and Worst Case</p>\n<p>Consider a linear search: we want to find an element in a list and return its (first) position, or -1 if it's not there.\nprocedure linear_search(list, value)\nfor i from 0 to length(list)-1\nif list[i] == value\nreturn i\nreturn -1\nHow many steps there?\nThe answer is: it depends.\nIf the thing we're looking for is in the first position, it takes (\\Theta(1)) steps.\nIf it's at the end, or not there, it takes (\\Theta(n)) steps.\nThe easiest thing to count is usually the worst case: what is the maximum steps required for any input of size (n)?\nThe worst case is that we go all the way to the end of the list, but don't find it and return -1.\nThe only line that makes sense to count here is the if line. It's in the inner-most loop, and is executed for every iteration.\nWe could also count the number of comparisons made: the == and the implicit comparison in the for loop.\nThat is either (n) or (2n+1) steps, so (\\Theta(n)) complexity.\nThe other useful option is the average case: what is the average steps required over all inputs of size (n)?\nMuch harder to calculate, since you need to consider every possible input to the algorithm.\nEven if we assume the element is found, the possible number of comparisons are:\nFound in position Comparisons\n1 2\n2 4\n⋮ ⋮\n(n) (2n)\nOn average, the number of comparisons is: [\\frac{2+4+\\cdots+2n}{n} = n+1,.]\nAgain, we have (\\Theta(n)) complexity.\n… but it's a good thing we checked. Some algorithms are different.\nGood/bad times</p>\n<p>We have said that these running times are important when it comes to running times of algorithm.\nBut we are throwing away a lot of information when we look only at big-O/Ω/Θ.\nThe lower-order terms must mean something.\nThe leading constants definitely do.\nAssuming one million operations per second, this is the approximate running time of an algorithm given running time, with an input of size (n):\n(n) (\\log<em>2 n) (n) (n\\log</em>2 n) (n^2) (n^{3}) (2^n)\n(10) 3.3 μs 10 μs 33 μs 100 μs 1 ms 1 ms\n(10^2) 6.6 μs 100 μs 664 μs 10 ms 1 s (4\\times 10^{16}) years\n(10^4) 13 μs 10 ms 133 ms 1.7 minutes 11.6 days (10^{2997}) years\n(10^6) 20 μs 1 s 20 s 11.6 days 32000 years (10^{300000}) years\nMaybe that gives a little idea why we'll only worry about complexity\n… at least at first.\nA summary:\nIf you can get (O(\\log n)) life is good: hand it in and go home.\n(O(n\\log n)) is pretty good: hard to complain about it.\n(O(n^k)) could be bad, depending on (k): you won't be solving huge problems. These are polynomial complexity algorithms for (k\\ge 1).\n(\\Omega(k^n)) is a disaster: almost as bad as no algorithm at all if you have double-digit input sizes. These are exponential complexity algorithms for (k\\gt 1).\nSee also: Numbers everyone should know\nA problem that has a polynomial-time algorithm is called tractable.\nNo polynomial time algorithm: intractable.\nThere is a big category of problems that nobody has a polynomial-time algorithm for, but also can't prove that none exists: the NP-complete problems.\nSome examples: Boolean satisfiability, travelling salesman, Hamiltonian path, many scheduling problems, Sudoku (size (n)).\nIf you have an algorithm with a higher complexity than necessary, no amount of clever programming will make up for it.\nNo combination of these will make a (O(n^2)) algorithm faster than an (O(n\\log n)): faster language, better optimizer, hand-optimization of code, faster processor.\nImportant point: the complexity notations only say things about large (n).\nIf you always have small inputs, you might not care.\nAlgorithms with higher complexity class might be faster in practice, if you always have small inputs.\ne.g. Insertion sort has running time (\\Theta(n^2)) but is generally faster than (\\Theta(n\\log n)) sorting algorithms for lists of around 10 or fewer elements.\nThe most important info that the complexity notations throw away is the leading constant.\nThere is a difference between (n^2) instructions and (100n^2) instructions to solve a problem.\nOnce you have the right big-O, then it's time to worry about the constants.\nThat's what clever programming can do.\nWhen we're talking about algorithms (and not programming), the constants don't usually matter much.\nIt's rare to have an algorithm with a big leading constant.\nSo it's not really possible to decide between the algorithms.\nUsually it's a choice between (4n\\log n) or (5n\\log n): you probably have to implement, compile, and profile to decide for sure.\nExample: sorting algorithms. There are several algorithms to sort a list/array.\nInsertion/Selection/Bubble Sorts: (\\Theta(n^2)).\nMerge/Heap Sorts: (\\Theta(n\\log n)).\nQuicksort: (\\Theta(n\\log n)) average case but (very rarely) (\\Theta(n^2)) worst case.\nBut quicksort is usually faster in practice.\n… except when it isn't.\nSeveral recent languages/libraries have implemented a heavily-optimized mergesort (e.g. Python, Perl, Java ≥JDK1.3, Haskell, some STL implementations) instead of Quicksort (C, Ruby, some other STL implementations).\nSpace Complexity</p>\n<p>We have only been talking about running time/speed so far.\nIt also makes good sense to talk about the complexity of other things.\nMost notably, memory use by an algorithm.\nAn algorithm that uses (\\Theta(n^{3})) space is bad. Maybe as bad as (\\Theta(n^{3})) time.\nAn algorithm that uses (O(1)) extra space (in addition to space needed to store the input) is called in-place.\ne.g. selection sort is in-place, but mergesort ((\\Theta(n)) extra space) and Quicksort ((\\Theta(\\log n)) extra space, average case) aren't.</p>","id":"aa82c0c8-f22d-5170-8279-77e177d15931","timeToRead":6,"frontmatter":{"title":"Complexity of Algorithms","subtitle":"Are algorithms that complex?","excerpt":"The whole point of the big-O/Ω/Θ stuff was to be able to say something useful about algorithms.","path":"/tech/algorithm-complexity","category":"tech","date":"July 17, 2016","author":{"name":"Brian Lusina","link":"/brian_lusina","avatar":"brian_lusina.jpg"},"image":{"feature":"algorithm-complexity.jpg","thumbnail":"algorithm-complexity.jpg","teaser":"algorithm-complexity.jpg","credit":null,"creditlink":null},"tags":["complexity of algorithms","algorithms"],"published":true}}}}}
