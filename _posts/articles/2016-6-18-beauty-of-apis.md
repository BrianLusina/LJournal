An Application Programming Interface or API for short is a set of routines protocols for buidling software programs. An API simply provides the building blocks and the programmer's task is to piece it all together


# Types of APIs

There are several types of APIs. Ranging from ones in operating systems to applications and websites. A simple example is when you copy and paste text from one application to another. An API allows that to work.
Most operating environments, provide APIs which allow programmers to write applications consistent with the operating environment.

There are APIs specified for websites. The eBay API, for example allows developers to use the existing retail infrastructure to create specialized web stores. Third-party software developers also use Web APIs to create software solutions for end-users.

# Example of APIs

There are many APIs in existence and many more are being created as we speak. These APIs consistently and continually help developers create applications that provide the best experience to the user. They also enable the developer not strain to *re-invent the wheel*.

Some of the top most examples of APIs:
+ Twitter APIs: 
	Twitter offers two APIs, the [**REST**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer "More about REST API") and **Search API**
The REST API allows developer access to core Twitter data while the Search API allows the developer to *search* for data such as popular trends

+ Google Maps API:
	This has to be one of the most popular APIs used to date. As the name probably suggests, this particular API allows a developer to embed Google Maps on webpages using JavaScript or Flash interface. This enables the developer to acces the Google Maps data and enable the developer to access various locations on the Google Maps, so to speak.

+ Flickr API:
	This API in particular enables developer to acces data of photo sharing community of Flickr. It consists of a set of callable methods and API endpoints

+ YouTube API:
	Allows the developer to  integrate YouTube videos and functionality into websites or applications. YouTube APIs include the YouTube Analytics API, YouTube Data API, YouTube Live Streaming API, YouTube Player APIs and others.

+ Open Weather API:
	This is my personal favourite, this particular API allows the user to access Weather data from various location in the world.
Also, it grants access to the weather forecast of the area and detailed weather information such as Rain, humidity, wind speed, etc.
