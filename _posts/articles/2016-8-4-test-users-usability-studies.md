Following my [previous](https://brianlusina.github.io/Paper-Rabbit/articles/usability-and-code/) article, I think it best to write about how many users are the optimal number to conduct a usability test with. Most would argue that you need hundreds to come up with an optimal number, say, 100? However, this would be wrong, very wrong. In fact, based on my own personal research the number is 5, except when it is not. This means the optimal number is 5, but then again depends on a couple of factors.

Why 5 though? This lets you find almost as many usability problems as you'd find using many more test participants. With 5 users, you almost always get close to user testing's maximum benefit-cost ratio.

There are exceptions to the rule of course.

+ **Quantitative studies aim at statistics more than on insights**. In this case test at least 20 users to get statistically significant numbers; tight confidence intervals require even more users.

+ **Card Sorting** test at least 15 users.

+ **Eyetracking** Test 39 users if you want stable heatmaps.

These exceptions shouldn't worry you much. The vast majority of your user research should be qualitative, aimed at collecting insights to drive your design, not numbers to impress people in PowerPoint.

The main argument for small tests is simply **return on investment**. Testing costs increase with each additional study participant, yet the number of findings quickly reaches the point of diminishing returns. There's little additional benefit to running more than 5 people through the same study; ROI drops like a stone with a bigger number.

And if you have a big budget? Spend it on additional studies, not more users in each study.

## Arguments for more Test participants

1. **A big website has tons of users.** Doesn't matter for the sample size, even if you were doing statistics. The variance in statistical sampling is determined by the sample size, not the size of the full population from which the sample was drawn. In user testing, we focus on a website's functionality to see which design elements are easy or difficult to use. The evaluation of a design element's quality is independent of how many people use it. (Conversely, the decision about whether to fix a design flaw should certainly consider how much use it'll get: it might not be worth the effort to improve a feature that has few users; better to spend the effort recoding something with millions of users.).
