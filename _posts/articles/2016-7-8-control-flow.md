---

Order of execution of code in a program. Code is w=executed from top to bottom.

# IF Statements

If statements are one of the most common control flow algorithms. They are used to make certain decisions. A program is given the ability to make decisions and output results based on that condition. As the name suggests, it simply means execute the code block **if** a certain condition is true

Structure:
			if(condition to check){
				//statements to execute if condition evaluates to true
			}
```Java

public class Control{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		int x = 0;
		if(x>10)
	}
}
```
