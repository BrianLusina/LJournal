Algorithms are steps taken to solve a problem. Analysis of an algorithm helps us determine whether the algorithm is useful or not. Once we have a correct algorithm we have to determine whether the algorithm is efficient or not. Effieciency in any running system is important to achieve maximum performance within a given amount of time. Complexity should be at a minimum. Abstraction is key in this process.

# Time Complexity Categories

+ **Worst Case complexity**: When the amount ot time required by an algorithm for a given input is maximum.

+ **Average-case complexity**: When the amount of time required by an algorithm for a given input is average.

+ **Best case complexity**: When the amount of time required by an algorithm for a given input is minimum.
