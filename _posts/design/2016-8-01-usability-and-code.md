A lot of people associate designing stellar applications with skill alone. That it just takes one brilliant out of the blue idea to create something that everyone will suddenly realize they need. Sometimes this happens, but more often than not it does not. A lot of applications are built to fill a gap that people have craved to be filled. To find this gap you need to first know that it is there, you need to identify if people acknowledge it is a gap as well and also you need to be able to determine if said people need a complex technology to fill this gap or do they simply need a pen and paper. Not all problems need technology to get solved.

Now, say that you find a problem that can be solved with technology. Say, your particular software can help provide a particular solution to the problem. This is always good to identify, that it helps to solve the problem. The question breaks down to is it something the users can use with ease and can they learn easily to use it or do they need the whole documentation you used to build it?

This brings me to **usability**. A term that is so rarely used, but a term I think is necessary and important in the world of designing technology.

## Usability

Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. The word *usability* also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process.

The 5 components associated with usability:

+ **Learnability** Is it easy for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?
+ **Efficiency** Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
+ **Memorability** When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?
+ **Errors** How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?
+ **Satisfaction** How pleasant is it to use the design?

Another key attribute is **utility**, which refers to the design's functionality: *Does it do what users need?*

Usability and utility are equally important and together determine whether something is useful: It matters little that something is easy if it's not what you want. It's also no good if the system can hypothetically do what you want, but you can't make it happen because the user interface is too difficult. To study a design's utility, you can use the same user research methods that improve usability.

So, utility is simply whether it provides the features you need. Usability is how easy & pleasant these features are to use. Combining the two leads to a product being *useful*.

## Importance of Usability

The first law of e-commerce is that if users cannot find the product, they cannot buy it either. This means that if a user can not clearly understand your site and get all the information they need from the get go, they **leave**.

> On the Web, usability is a necessary condition. If a website is difficult to use, people exit. If the homepage fails to clearly state what a company offers and what users can do on the site, people leave. If users get lost on a website, they leave. If a website's information is hard to read or doesn't answer users' key questions, they leave. Note a pattern here? There's no such thing as a user reading a website manual or otherwise spending much time trying to figure out an interface. There are plenty of other websites available; leaving is the first line of defense when users encounter a difficulty.


## Improving usability

The most basic and useful way to improve usability is **user testing**, which has 3 components:

+ **Get hold of some representative users**, such as customers for an e-commerce site.
+ Ask the users to **perform representative** tasks with the design.
+ **Observe what the users do**, where they succeed, and where they have difficulties with the user interface. Shut up and let the users do the talking.

It's important to test users individually and let them solve any problems on their own. If you help them or direct their attention to any particular part of the screen, you have contaminated the test results.
To identify a design's most important usability problems, testing 5 users is typically enough. Rather than run a big, expensive study, it's a better use of resources to run many small tests and revise the design between each one so you can fix the usability flaws as you identify them. Iterative design is the best way to increase the quality of user experience. The more versions and interface ideas you test with users, the better.

User testing is different from focus groups, which are a poor way of evaluating design usability. Focus groups have a place in market research, but to evaluate interaction designs you must closely observe individual users as they perform tasks with the user interface. Listening to what people say is misleading: you have to watch what they actually do.

## When to Work on Usability

Usability plays a role in each stage of the design process. The resulting need for multiple studies is the reason individual studies should be fast and cheap. Here are the main steps:

+ Before starting the new design, **test the old design** to identify the good parts that you should keep or emphasize, and the bad parts that give users trouble.

+ **Test your competitors' designs** to get cheap data on a range of alternative interfaces that have similar features to your own.

+ **Conduct a field study** to see how users behave in their natural habitat.

+ Make **paper prototypes** of one or more new design ideas and test them. The less time you invest in these design ideas the better, because you'll need to change them all based on the test results.

+ **Refine the design ideas** that test best through multiple iterations, gradually moving from low-fidelity prototyping to high-fidelity representations that run on the computer. Test each iteration.

+ **Inspect the design relative to established usability guidelines** whether from your own earlier studies or published research.
Once you decide on and implement the final design, test it again. Subtle usability problems always creep in during implementation.

+ **Don't defer user testing until you have a fully implemented design**. If you do, it will be impossible to fix the vast majority of the critical usability problems that the test uncovers. Many of these problems are likely to be structural, and fixing them would require major rearchitecting.

The only way to a high-quality user experience is to start user testing early in the design process and to keep testing every step of the way.

## Testing, 1, 2, 3

If you run at least one user study per week, it's worth building a dedicated usability laboratory. For most companies, however, it's fine to conduct tests in a conference room or an office â€” as long as you can close the door to keep out distractions. What matters is that you get hold of real users and sit with them while they use the design. A notepad is the only equipment you need.

## Conclusion

Usability is just as important as the design and it goes a long way in creating software that not only solves a particular problem but also allows the user to enjoy using it the software at the same time.
