Software development the world of technology is constantly shifting & changing. No 2 years are ever the same. New technologies are developed, old ones are improved and ideologies are challenged every single day. With this kind of climate, it is often difficult for any engineer to navigate without at some point hitting a wall or 2. Oftentimes developers struggle to find a true north to stick to due to the constant change in the tides & new upcoming trends that often leave everyone wondering if what they have been learning for the past year is worth it anymore.

Truth is, we have all been here & I would bet that any engineer who claims has not had any struggles understanding and surfing this wave of _technological change_ has not truly been working in this industry as they claim they have. A little context is necessary.

[Golang](https://golang.org/) is now a very popular programming language & is used almost everywhere & is the go to programming language for cloud computing(which by the way now runs the world as it is), but it is just slightly 10 years old. No one saw this shift happening. It is not only popular for cloud, but it is being used everywhere now, even [IoT](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-the-internet-of-things-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-iot-right-now/) devices & in distributed systems because of how the language was built. 10 years ago, no one would have even thought that a language could change the very ideology of how people build software. This speaks to the fact that the tech world will always shift & there will be something 10 years from now that will be used to power the next generation of computing.

With this in mind, a lot of new developers always struggle to find a balance between being relevant & learning something that will set them apart for years to come. This is due to the fact that there is a lot of *noise* in the industry with new buzzwords & terminologies that could confuse anyone & everyone. But if you look closely, they are not really new. Most of these new technologies are just old technologies that have been re-branded to fit in the current fast moving world. It is because back in the 80s & 70s, there was no supporting hardware or technology for what we have now to exist. But, the ideas were there, we just could not execute them.

Now, why would I sort of digress like this? This is to just highlight that it is fundamental to learn the basics of software development & by that I mean good practices of building modern day technologies with an allowance for it to improve & be built upon. This is agnostic to any programming language, framework, tool or cloud technology. This is the very building block of software development. In this day & age we get caught up in the latest front-end framework someone knows to the most recent cutting edge back-end development a company is using to the hosting solution we are adopting to run all these applications to the point that we forget to just build good software. At the end of the day, all these are tools, but let me emphasise, *it is important to pick the right tools for the job*. No carpenter will pick a screw driver to hammer in a nail, when it is obvious that a hammer will be perfect for the job. That is why there are many options in software development & herein lies the beauty of it & the confusion at the same time.

Now as a recently fresh graduate of any coding boot-camp or any school that teaches software development it is quite common to have a lot of questions about the industry. Especially how to navigate it. You will come out with certain skill sets, but the reality of it is they will never be enough for the industry as it is right now. It is at this point that you realise you need to go far & beyond & build on top of what you know & this needs, no, _has_ to be a constant endeavour.

Growing your career as a software developer is a constant effort & will require discipline & this goes for any career out there. You have to put in the work to constantly improve on your skills (both non-technical & technical). There is simply no shortcut, you just have to work at it. Some of the things you can do are:

+ *Attend conferences and webinars*(at this time due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this is very possible to attend conferences that you possibly never could due to either distance or financial constraints)

  This gives you a wider view of how the current industry is shaped & allows you to adapt to it & learn new things & see what gaps you have in your knowledge base

+ *Network with your peers*. It is important to network with people & learn from them. You will not be able to learn everything there is to learn in the world. This is where networking comes in. Speaking to other developers gives you insights into what else you can do with your knowledge base. Stuck with a bug? How about you reach out to a friend before reaching for Google? You never know. They could have literally solved the same issue a few minutes prior.

+ *Read, read & read*. This is key for me. I suppose because a lot of times some developers do not take the time to actually dive into documentation provided in tools or programming languages that they are using & just immediately dive into Stack Overflow & even though SO is a great tool. Chances are you just did not read the fine print in the documentation. Also adding on top of that, take the time to read some software engineering books & articles. This will give you even more insights into the software world.

+ Find a mentor who will act as a guide for you. This will help as they will warn you of any missteps & encourage you on decisions that you may be hesitant to make. I think it is important to highlight that it is not the mentor's responsibility to be checking up on you all the time. It is up to you to communicate what progress you have been making in your growth & assistance you may need. This is an initiative that you have to make.

+ *Join a software community & be part of discussions* & ask silly questions if you have to & no, I am not talking about Stack Overflow(in as much as it is a community). I am talking about a software development community in your region or even globally. There are a lot of ways to do so(Slack, Telegram, Github, Discord, Reddit, etc). These communities are vibrant & always have interesting discussions on topics that you can learn from.

+ _Collaborate on a software project or product_. Key word being *collaborate*. This is because no great software is built by one person a lone. This is the new way of working. This is how big players in the industry are building new technologies & tools. They are being built by people & there is no exclusion on who can work on what. This is especially key in open source technologies. They are built by communities & for the communities. You being able to work on a software project along with other developers, helps a lot in your growth as a software developer & shows that you can work in a team.

As you can tell, the things that I have mentioned above have not catered or talked about technical skill at all, but this is not to say that technical skills aren't important. They very much are! But, these go hand in hand with them. The reason for highlighting these, is that a lot times, developers ignore these things or never look out for them, because they do not regard them as important, thinking that they do not matter.

On a technical level, it is important to first know your programming language like the back of your hand. Be able to read it like you would read any English(or your mother tongue) text. Be able to interpret it to a point you can explain to anyone else in a very concise & simple way. Yes, this takes time & practice, a lot of it. But it is important that you do this. The reason for this, is that at the end of the day, you will be writing code & if you can't understand your own code, how else do you expect the machine to understand what you want it to do?

There are many other technical skills you need to have & these speak a lot to the key competencies that a lot of employers & companies look for in software developers. I am about to sound like every Job Description(JD) out there, but really, they are key & organisations do not take the time to write them down for nothing. These speak to the values they seek in candidates:

+ _Know your stack & know it well_. If you say you are a back-end developer or choose the path of a front-end developer or mobile developer, it is important that you know your technologies & tools well. These tools should not sound very new to you when they are mentioned. Especially during an interview. It would really hurt your chances, when a certain technology or tool is mentioned & you are oblivious about it yet it should be part of your toolbox. There are certain tools that you expect to find in a tool-shed of any carpenter. Now imagine going to a carpenter, asking him to make a bed for you or any article of furniture & you realise he does not have certain tools(say, a hammer, screw driver, saw, you name it) & when you ask him/her about it, they are completely confused by what you are saying. Would you still hire them for the job?
+ *Be an advocate for testing* & I am not talking about manual testing where you run on _localhost_ & then say you are good to go. I am talking about automated testing, being able to test your code fully. This means understanding that bugs don't crop up out of nowhere, they crop up from not catching edge cases that could have been caught by a simple unit test.
+ _Know about certain paradigms or processes that are common in software development, especially in this day & age_. An example is Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment abbreviated as CI/CD. This is very common in this new age of software development & there are a lot of tools that aid in this paradigm & as a software developer it is important to know them & be able to use them. Almost every organisation has adapted to using CI/CD patterns following the advent of Agile practices, as it is a faster way to deliver software to people that benefit people & the business at large. As an engineer you need to know how to use these tools & fit them into your workflow. This means being able to know what is needed to build, package & distribute your application to the masses. Think of your piece of software like processed food. You have to find a way for it to continuously be shipped out to the market for people to consume or they die(not literal in this case, but I hope you get the gist of it).

Of course this is not an exhaustive list & with how the software world keeps evolving there are a lot more things that you need to be aware of & learn.

I could go on with more letters & words describing all you need to grow in this career, but the truth is, there is just a lot of things happening in this industry to fit them all in 1 article. I am sure by the time you are done reading this, there will be a new JS library ready for use (:D), that is just how quickly the industry is moving & shifting these days & as an individual it is important to know where you are, what you have, then to know what you need to go & what you need to get there & then just work on it constantly with zeal & passion.

So, what does it take to build & have a successful career in software development? I would say first humility, then discipline.
