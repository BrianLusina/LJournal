Live each day to the fullest. Get the most from each hour, each day and for each age of your life. Then you can look forward with confidence and back without regrets. Be yourself, but be your best self. Dare to be different and to follow your start and don't be afraid to be happy.

Enjoy what is beautiful. Love withh all your heart and soul. Believe that those whom you love, love you.
Forget what you have done for your friends and remember what they have done for your. Disregard what the world owes you and concentrate on what you owe the world.

When you are faced with a decision, make that decision as wisely as possible - then forget about it. The moment of absoulte certainty never arrives. Above all, remember that God helps those who help themselts. Act as if everything depended on you and pray as if everything dependend on God.
