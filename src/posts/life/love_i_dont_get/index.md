title: I don't understand love
subtitle: Thoughts on love that are simply confusing
excerpt: It has always been a confusing thing what love is about and what it is actually(to me). Confusing in the sense that is it simply a chemical reaction that is triggered based on factors? Is it something that is divine that mere mortals can not understand and only the lucky few get to have a true taste of it?

It has always been a confusing thing what love is about and what it is actually(to me). Confusing in the sense that is it simply a chemical reaction that is triggered based on factors? Is it something that is divine that mere mortals can not understand and only the lucky few get to have a true taste of it?

I have to admit, it has been a constant struggle for me. I can say that I have had terrible luck. I have a higher chance of finding a million dollars in my bank account randomly showing up than actually finding love when I step out of my door daily. And I mean true love. Not the love of money, things, possessions. I mean, we all love those, they do have a way of making life just a little bit easier. What I am talking about is love for other humans, love that is simply without any strings attached. The reason I say this, is due to recent events. And by recent, I mean the past year. A while back, I was in a relationship. It lasted a solid 4 months(I guess). I can honestly say that it did not go as planned. Not that you can plan a relationship from the beginning. It is never a straight line, a lot of zig-zags are expected along the way and the true test of a relationship is when there are so many blurred lines and a bit of confusion, but at the end of the day, you still choose each other. Well, at the very least, I think that would be the case. I have not quite been able to say that I have been doing that. My last one has problems and I admit, I was 70% of those problems. I guess I dove too soon? Maybe I chose wrong? Nah, it has to be the fact that I felt I needed to be in one. Instead of feeling like I wanted to be in one.

Initially though, I did want to be in one and that is why I took my time and actually asked myself, do I want this? But, I don't think I answered my own question, before suddenly, I found myself in one and I was soon enough realizing that it is not what appears in movies. Where the couples are constantly happy, smiling, laughing, singing even (I saw a movie where this happened once).
