Learning to code is never an easy endevour, especially in the world of technology, where there always seems to be something new that you must learn or know in order to keep up with the trends of the 21st century. It is such a fluid and ever changing world that you can find yourself lost in the pursuit of knowledge.

Despite this, it is still a pursuit that keeps one growing and learning. These are the most important things when starting out on a journey to learn technology and dive into its depths. Sometimes the journey is full of twists and turns, long nights and early mornings, short weekends and long weekdays, even rough days and good ones, but overall, what makes me most happy is the ability to be able to create something that betters other people's lives. Makes them easier, makes them focus on what is most important in life instead of focusing on the menial tasks that we have the ability to automate.

I remember when I wrote my first lines of code. I had just finished high school and had a lot of free time on my hands before joining campus (8 months). With this amount of time at one's disposal, it is easy to get lost in all that is happening around without proper planning. I enrolled for the usual classes everyone enrolled for after finishing high shool; Computer classes(Computer package classes, Driving classes, Accounting classes, etc.). I wanted to keep busy, so this gave me the chance to stay out of the house and not lose my mind. Of course all these classes only lasted 4 months, so the extra 4 months was spent attending bootcamps that span 3 weeks or less. It is during that time, that I discovered that one could actually create programs with code.

The irony of it all was that my curiosity for technology was not inspired at all by attending computer classes, it was in fact inspired by a program that taught people how to type (mostly used by secretaries to train and improve their typing speed). I was curious as to how this simple program knew the keys I typed in and how it measured the speed at which I typed words. It was magic to me. I wanted to understand how it was built, I was _waay_ beyond the why of it all (Improve people's typing speed), I wanted to know __how__.

So, I dove into Google and typed in _how to build a computer program_, and waited for the search results to guide me to an answer. Of course, then, there were now sites like [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com), [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com), etc, so the search was even more difficult. I stumbed upon [Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic) and I began downloading all the required tutorials I needed to understand __how__ one builds a program, how to start, what you need, all the required tools that should be at your disposal and I just started.

Fast forward 3 weeks later, after a lot of trial and error and the first program I built was a simple Trivia which was basically a bunch of *if else* statements that checked for your answer. I didn't care that it was horrible, looked bad or was slow, I just wanted to build something, to see it used and to understand what it took to build a program that did something and made someone's life better (in this case help you become better at trivia questions). It worked! My first ever program! Too bad there was no way of sharing it with the world (because I had no idea how to). So I explored further into how do people share what they create and how do other people then download and install these programs and that lead me to networking and how the internet works(for some reason also lead me to how viruses work, go figure).

All this digging around for information made me realize how technology had the potential to change my life as well. I was learning, growing, hungry...for knowledge. I simply wanted to understand, I wanted to know the __why__ of it all.

Technology has had a major positive impact ever since. Being part of teams that build highly scalable applications has not only brought out the best in me, but has also shown me what I still need to learn and what I still need to do to get better.

A couple of things that I have learned along the way:

1. __Have zero tolerance for the victim mentality__. I have learned to become deliberate about regularly upskiling myself through reading books, learning new skills, meeting and interacting with new people in different fields and industry.

2. __Be very deliberate about where you are and understant the opportunity cost of where you are__. Understand your true value including your weaknesses. Focus on up-scaling yourself.

3. __Where you work has a major impact on your work-life harmony__. If you work for a company that re-inforces you and you konow your work will create value, you will remain satisfied and extremely motivated that you hardly feel burn out. This is important especially in a tech field, where there is an ever changing need for how products serve customers, you need to be in a place that gives you the opportunity to balance your work and life ina way that does not sacrfice one for the other.
