subtitle:  What is algorithm analysis
excerpt:  Algorithms are steps taken to solve a problem. Analysis of an algorithm helps us determine whether the algorithm is useful or not. Once we have a correct algorithm we have to determine whether the algorithm is efficient or not. Effieciency in any running system is important to achieve maximum performance within a given amount of time. Complexity should be at a minimum. Abstraction is key in this process.

Algorithms are steps taken to solve a problem. Analysis of an algorithm helps us determine whether the algorithm is useful or not. Once we have a correct algorithm we have to determine whether the algorithm is efficient or not. Effieciency in any running system is important to achieve maximum performance within a given amount of time. Complexity should be at a minimum. Abstraction is key in this process.

# Time Complexity Categories

Measures the time taken for an algorithm to execute a problem given a certain input. Categories include:

- **Worst Case complexity**: When the amount ot time required by an algorithm for a given input is maximum.

- **Average-case complexity**: When the amount of time required by an algorithm for a given input is average.

- **Best case complexity**: When the amount of time required by an algorithm for a given input is minimum.

# Space Complexity

Space taken by an algorithm to execute a given problem. This depends on the data structure being worked on

# Asymptotic Analysis

Kind of analysis done to calculate the complexity of an algorithm in its theoretical analysis. A alarge length of input is used to calculate the complexity function of the algorithm. A graph is usually used.
Asymptotic denotes a condition where a line tends to meet a curve, but they do not intersect. Here the line and the curve is asymptotic to each other. It involves computing the running time of any any operation in mathematical units of computation.
The _Big-O-notation_ is used for this

## Asymptotic notations

- Big-O notation usually denoted as **O**. Usually used
- Omega
- Theta
