Whenever one hears the term _Command Line_, they shudder and instantly think one has to memorize and remember strange words and code that could possibly only be understood by a machine. True, the command line is quite a hurdle to master, but when truly understood, it not only becomes easier navigating your machine, but it becomes your superpower. First and foremost, what is the Command Line?

## Command Line?

Command Line Interface or popularly known as **CLI** is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines). Hence the name _command line_.

Typically it looks like this:

Admittedly, it does look intimidating, but it is a very powerful tool.

## Advantages of CLI

- **It Requires fewer resources**
  The CLI is in every computer and laptop, it is even in smartphones. It is the basic software that comes with every machine and requires very little resources to operate.

* **Concise and powerful**
  CLI is extremely powerful and allows you access to every part of your machine. In addition, it is very concise and allows execution of commands with very little command input.

- **Easier to automate via scripting**
  Once you become an expert in CLI, it becomes relatively easy when it comes to automating through scripting. This allows you to run programs like Node.js and/or coffeescript

## Disadvantages

- **Commands not obvious.**
  One of the major downsides to the CLI, is the fact that not all the commans are quite obvious. This is one of the reasons that make it not particularly enticing to aspiring developers as the commans are not as intuitive and easy to understand at first glance.

* **Not visually rich**
  Admittedly, the CLI was not build for visual appeal. Usually it is a black background with monospace font. There are modifications to allow modification of the font and background color, but it will still lack the visual appeal of most IDEs.

- **Beginner - unfriendly**.
  If you are starting out on CLI, it is an uphill task and requires practice and more practice. So, for a beginner, this is even harder to grasp at the beginning. But, then again, what is easy at the outset?
