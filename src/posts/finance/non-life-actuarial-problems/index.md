The title may not be as intuitive or as smart as it should be, but I assure that the title is the least of concerns. This may be a very common topic when it comes to the insurance sector, but, hey, why not shed some more light on it anyway.

Insurance is very critical to business and in order for these businesses to keep operating despite calamities, they need insurance to ensure that no matter what happens they can keep their doors open.

But, this is on the side of businesses and that is entirely different, today I shall shed some light on the fundamental problems of _Non life insurance_ on Insurance companies. Call it flipping the coin and viewing it from the other side.

This is a high-level view of what I am talking about.

Actuaries deal with all kinds of mathematical and statistical problems in insurance. Insurance companies accept risks (potential claims) from their clients against a certain price called the premium. If a risk or a portfolio of risks is too large for a company, it will pass parts of it to one or several companies (its _re-insurance_) and remain with a part of it (its _retention_). If a risk is very large, some re-insurers pass parts of the acceptances to other companies so that the original risk or portfolio is covered by an entire network of insurers and re-insurance arrangements between a number of companies each of them carrying the retention they deem appropriate. Therefore, the amount of a company retains depend on a lot of things:

### Capital of a company

This is obviously a big deal. A company with a large capital base can afford to retain more on its account than a company with a smaller capital base.

### Management risk willingness

This all depends on the management and their risk appetite. The only question to ask here is _is the management willing to take risks?_. And this usually leads to, _if so, how much?_. A manager with a smaller risk appetite will not take as much risk as his/her counterpart. Thus we expect the former to retain less on the company account.

### Profitability of the company

How profitable will be company be in undertaking a risk? We all know that the most basic of any company goal is to make a profit. It's usually hidden under the many missions and visions it share with the public. Internally, the company's main goal is to make a profit.
The _underwriter_ needs to set appropriate premiums and assess whether the portfolio will produce a profit given unusual claims are not reported.

These are just some of the basics and I will ensure to highlight more in days to come.
In the meantime, digest this information and comment if you like.

Cheers!
