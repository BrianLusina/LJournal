Following what I wrote about last [time](https://brianlusina.github.io//money/non-life-actuarial-problems/)(feel free to check it out), I will follow up with that and mention briefly the problems General insurance companies usually face when it comes to retaining risk especially when dealing with a portfolio.

The factors are(for those who are rebels and just will not read my previous article :D), _capital a company has_, _risk willingness_ and _profit margin_. These are the 3 main factors that determine what a company retains when it is faced with insuring a risk.

Retention of a company will be high if these 3 factors are high. This is usually governed by this formula:

$$Retention=(capital _ risk willingness _ profit margin)/unbalancness$$

And it is from this funny looking formula that we are able to determine the 5 main types of problems:

### 1. Rating

This is faced in premium calculation and is usually characterized by the formula:

$$Profit margin = (Retention _ unbalanceness) / (capital _ risk willingness)$$

### 2. Assessing Reserves

Characterized as **contingency reserves** or **risk capital** or **catastrophe funds**, this is determined by this formula:

$$Capital = (Retention _ Unbalanceness) / (Profit Margin _ Risk)$$

So as the name suggests, these are funds that are accessed when the company needs is in crisis.

### 3. Underwriting limit

This determines what amount of risk they should retain. Which is essentially the original formula:

$$Retention=(capital _ risk willingness _ profit margin)/unbalancness$$

### 4. Risk Behavior

Companies' entrepreneurial attitude towards risk can be categorized as their behavior towards risk. This formula can be used to determine or measure how conservative or not a company ought to be given its current circumstances.

$$Risk Willingness = (Retention _ Unbalanceness) / (Profit margin _ Capital)$$

### 5. Maximum tolerable risk load

A company may be able to bear on its gross account a certain amount of risk given its rate level, retention and financial strength as well as its behavior towards risk.

$$Unbalanceness = (Capital _ Risk willingness _ Profit margin) / retention$$

## Conclusion

As you will notice the 5 main problems are derived from the very same basic formula:

$$Retention=(capital _ risk willingness _ profit margin)/unbalancness$$

Most companies go by this formula, especially insurance companies. This is often used when governing how much they should retain on their account when they are faced with insuring a certain portfolio of risks.
