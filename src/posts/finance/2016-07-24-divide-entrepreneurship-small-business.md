Recently, I embarked on a journey to learn more about entrepreneurship. I realized it required great grit and determination to be not only the best but leave a mark that will live beyond you. But then there is this thing known as businesses, small businesses to be exact. Is there any difference at all between small businesses and entrepreneurship? If I were to, say, open up a shop in campus or in the city square, will I be known as an entrepreneur or as a small business owner? What is the difference? Is there even a difference?
