Paper Rabbit is simply a collection of all my thoughts and encounters in the world of code, design, business and projects I work on. It has code snippets of how I came to solve some challenges with code, design inspirations I use from time to time, also money problems and thoughts :D. Most are simple and others are bigger problems. Language focus is on *Java*, *Python* and *JavaScript*. Some snippets will have *Android* code in it and others will have *HTML* and *CSS*. As these are what we interact with mostly.

Feel free to peruse and enjoy the content, also make comments.
